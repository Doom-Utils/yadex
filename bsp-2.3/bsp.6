.TH bsp 6 1998-02-23 "BSP 2.3"

.SH NAME
bsp \- node builder for Doom wad files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbsp\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fB-o \fP\fIfile\fP] \fIfile\fP

.SH DISCLAIMER
This program is furnished on an AS IS basis for the fun of it.
id Software does not support this program.

.SH DESCRIPTION
BSP builds the node and blockmap resources for a level map in
a wad file. Level maps created with level editors and level
compilers won't run without this resources build by a node builder.
The program supports multilevel building, means it automatically
builds the resources for all levels found in the input wad file.
.LP
If the program is used without the \fB\-o\fP option it will create an output
wad file with the name \fBtmp.wad\fP.
.LP
BSP has some special effect features:
.LP
If a linedef has a sector tag >= 900, then it is treated as "precious"
and will not be split unless absolutely necessary. This is good to use
around borders of deep water, invisible stairs, etc.
.LP
Furthermore, just for a grin, if the linedef's tag is 999, then the
sidedef's x-offset set an angle adjustment in degrees to be
applied \-\- you can look straight at a wall, but it might come
right at you on both sides and "stretch".
.LP
BSP supports HOM-free transparent doors. Simply make the sector
referenced by the doortracks have a sector tag of >= 900. No need
to remember sector numbers and type them in on a command line \-\-
just use any sector tag >= 900 to permanently mark the sector
special.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-factor " number
Changes the cost assigned to seg splits. Factor can be any positive
integer, and the larger the factor, the more costly seg splits are.
A factor of 17 is the default and behaves just like earlier versions
of BSP.
Changing the factor can sometimes prevent visplane overflows in wads.
But then again, some wads have just too many visplane overflows,
experiment with the \fB\-factor\fP option before giving up.
.TP
.B \-noreject
Does not clobber already existing reject map.
.TP
.BI "\-o " file
Write output to \fIfile\fP instead of \fBtmp.wad\fP.
.TP
.BI "\-thold " number
Threshold for visplane overflow. May be used to report
more potential visplane overflows
if the \fB\-vpwarn\fP or \fB\-vpmark\fP options
estimate too few visplanes. Default threshold is 128.
.TP
.B \-vp
Attempts to prevent visplane overflows without loss of detail. Using the
option causes node line picker to choose node lines in a way that is
empirically known to reduce or eliminate visplane overflows.
.TP
.B \-vpmark
Marks visplane overflows with player starts. It's a good idea to write
to a separate output file when using this option! One can use an editor
then, play each alternate player start, and see if each one causes
visplane overflows, and then remove it. Usually no-clipping must be used,
at least to step out of walls, since it inserts player starts without
regards to collisions, and it uses walls as a basis for visplane
calculation.
.TP
.B \-vpwarn
Warns about potential visplane overflows.

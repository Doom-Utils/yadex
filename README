Yadex 1.0.1 (1999-01-02)

WHAT IS YADEX ?
    Yadex is a Doom/Doom II/Heretic level (wad) editor for X.

PREREQUISITES
    You need :
    - X11R6 and a display of at least 640x480x256,
    - a shareware or registered Doom/Doom II/Heretic iwad,
    - GNU make,
    - GCC or EGCS (it should work with other compilers but you'll
      have to tweak the makefile).

COMPILING
    Extract the archive in a new directory and type "make".
    You will get some warning messages from the compiler. Ignore them.

INSTALLING
    If you want to install in /usr/local/, just type "make install".
    If you want to install somewhere else, E.G. in /opt/yadex, add
    "PREFIX=/opt/yadex" on the make command line.

    -> BEWARE, the installation OVERWRITES the following files:
    /usr/local/bin/bsp
    /usr/local/bin/yadex
    /usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg
    /usr/local/man/man6/bsp.6
    /usr/local/man/man6/yadex.6
    /usr/local/share/games/doom.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/doom2.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/heretic.ygd

    Before you run Yadex, you need to tell it where to find your iwads.
    Open /usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg with your favourite text editor and
    append the appropriate values after "iwad1=", "iwad2=" and "iwad3=".
    If you don't want Doom II to be the default iwad, also change the
    "game=" line.

    You can now run Yadex by typing "yadex".
    A prompt should show. Type "e map01" and have fun !

    But there is much more to it than this so, for your own good, you are
    advised to read users_guide.html (or, short of it, pretend you have
    when I ask you).

DOCUMENTATION
    README             - This file.
    yadex.lsm          - The LSM entry.
    yadex(6)           - The good old terse man page.
    bsp(6)             - Ditto for BSP.
    users_guide.html   - What users should read.
    hackers_guide.html - For people who want to hack it.
    TODO               - A list of things I'd like to do.
    HISTORY            - History of changes & what's new.
    COPYING            - The license under which Yadex is distributed.
    COPYING.LIB        - The license under which Atclib is distributed.

    As Larry Wall would say : "did we mention that you should definitely
    consider reading users_guide.html ?"

STATUS
    Yadex is work in progress. It still lacks important features like a
    better interface, cut-and-paste, undo/redo, support for Boom and many
    more. I know. They will come faster if you help.

    The source code is a horrible mess. I'm not proud of it. Be indulgent.

LEGAL STATUS
    Yadex is GPL'd free software. It incorporates code from DEU 5.21
    that was put in the public domain in 1994 by Raphaël Quinet and
    Brendon Wyber. The rest is Copyright © 1997-1999 André Majorel.

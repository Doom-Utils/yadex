Yadex 1.7.900 (2005-03-28)

WHAT IS YADEX ?
    Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running X,
    including Linux. It supports Doom, Doom II, Ultimate Doom, Final
    Doom, Heretic, Doom press release pre beta and also, in a more or
    less limited way, Hexen, Strife and Doom alpha. It is available
    under the terms of the GPL.

PREREQUISITES
    You need :
    - Some flavour of Unix (known to work with AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX,
      Irix, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenUnix, QNX and Solaris),
    - X11R6 or X11R5 and a display of at least 640x480,
    - a Doom/Doom II/Heretic/Strife iwad (shareware/demo is OK),
    - GNU make (vanilla make won't do),
    - a standard C compiler (ISO 9899:1990),
    - a standard C++ compiler,
    - hypot() and either nanosleep() or usleep().

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
    To compile with the default options and install in /usr/local :

                    ./configure
                    make
                    su -c 'make install'

    To deviate from the defaults, you can pass ./configure one or more
    of the following options :

        --cc           C compiler (default: auto-detected gcc/c89/cc)
        --cxx          C++ compiler (default: auto-detected g++/c++/cxx)
        --cflags       C compiler flags (default -O)
        --cxxflags     C++ compiler flags (default -O)
        --ldflags      Linker flags (default none)
        --prefix       Installation path (default /usr/local)
	--x-includes   Path to the X11 headers (default: auto-detected)
	--x-libraries  Path to the X11 libraries (default: auto-detected)

    For example, to compile in 64-bit mode with GCC 3.3 and install in
    ~/yadex, you could do something along these lines :

                ./configure                            \
                    --cc       gcc-3.3                 \
                    --cflags   '-m64 -O2'              \
                    --cxx      g++-3.3                 \
                    --cxxflags '-m64 -O2 -fpermissive' \
                    --ldflags  -m64                    \
                    --prefix   ~/yadex
                make
                make install

    Got problems getting Yadex to compile ? See doc/faq.html.
    Got no problem ? Read the FAQ anyway. See doc/faq.html.
    
    Beware, the installation OVERWRITES the following files (assuming
    you're installing in /usr/local) :
           /etc/yadex/1.7.900/yadex.cfg
           /usr/local/bin/yadex
           /usr/local/bin/yadex-1.7.900
           /usr/local/man/man6/yadex.6
           /usr/local/man/man6/yadex-1.7.900.6
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doom.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doom02.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doom04.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doom05.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doom2.ygd 
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/doompr.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/heretic.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/hexen.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/strife.ygd
           /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.7.900/strife10.ygd

CONFIGURING AND RUNNING
    Before you run Yadex, you need to tell it where to find your iwads.
    Assuming you have installed in /usr/local, open
    /etc/yadex/1.7.900/yadex.cfg with your favourite text editor and
    insert the appropriate values for the parameters "iwad1", "iwad2",
    etc. If you don't want Doom II to be the default iwad, also change
    the value of the "game" parameter.

    You can now run Yadex by typing :
    
			  yadex

    A "yadex:" prompt should show. At that prompt, type this :
    
			  e map01

    or this :

			  e e1m1

    Have fun !

    HTML format. Start at :

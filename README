Yadex 1.4.0 (2000-03-31)

WHAT IS YADEX ?
    Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running X,
    including Linux. It supports Doom, Doom II, Ultimate Doom, Final
    Doom, Heretic, Doom press release pre beta and also, in a more or
    less limited way, Hexen, Strife and Doom alpha. It is available
    under the terms of the GPL.

PREREQUISITES
    You need :
    - Some flavour of Unix,
    - X11R6 or X11R5 and a display of at least 640x480x256,
    - a Doom/Doom II/Heretic/Strife iwad (shareware/demo is OK),
    - GNU make (vanilla make won't do),
    - a standard C compiler (ISO 9899:1990),
    - a standard C++ compiler,
    - hypot() and either nanosleep() or usleep().

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
    Type this :

                          make
                          su -c 'make install'

    Notes :
    1) If you get an error on -lX11, add X11LIBDIR=<dir> to the make
    command line, where <dir> is the path to your libX11* files.
    E.G. "make X11LIBDIR=/usr/lpp/X11/lib"
    
    2) If you want to install somewhere else than in /usr/local/bin,
    add PREFIX=<dir> to the "make install" command line.
    E.G. "su -c 'make install PREFIX=/opt/yadex'"
      or "make install PREFIX=~"

    3) Beware, the installation OVERWRITES the following files:
    /usr/local/bin/ybsp
    /usr/local/bin/ybsp-1.4.0
    /usr/local/bin/yadex
    /usr/local/bin/yadex-1.4.0
    /usr/local/etc/yadex/1.4.0/yadex.cfg
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doom.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doom02.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doom04.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doom05.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doom2.ygd 
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/doompr.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/heretic.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/hexen.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/strife.ygd
    /usr/local/share/games/yadex/1.4.0/strife10.ygd
    /usr/local/[share/]man/man6/ybsp.6
    /usr/local/[share/]man/man6/yadex.6

CONFIGURING AND RUNNING
    Before you run Yadex, you need to tell it where to find your iwads.
    Open /usr/local/etc/yadex/1.4.0/yadex.cfg with your favourite
    text editor and insert the appropriate values for the parameters
    "iwad1", "iwad2", etc. If you don't want Doom II to be the default
    iwad, also change the value of the "game" parameter.

    You can now run Yadex by typing :
    
			  yadex

    A "yadex:" prompt should show. At that prompt, type this :
    
			  e map01

    or this :

			  e e1m1

    Have fun !

DOCUMENTATION
    There are man pages and quite a lot of documentation, most of it in
    HTML format. Start at :

                          doc/index.html

STATUS
    Yadex is work in progress. It still lacks important features like a
    better interface, cut-and-paste, undo/redo, support for Boom and
    many more. I know. They will come faster if you help. The source
    code is a horrible mess. I'm not proud of it. Be indulgent.

    that was put in the public domain in 1994 by Raphaël Quinet and

History of releases

----------------------------------------


AYM 1997-08-20

  First version ever released.
  Sent to JVDV (reported no bug).

AYM 1997-11-01

  - Added "Make rectangular nook" and "Make rectangular boss" in
    linedef misc. operations.

  Sent to JVDV.
  Sent to JK.

AYM 1997-11-30

  - Added full support for Doom II : uses sector and sidedef textures
    from doom2.wad.

  Sent to JK (said it worked fine).

AYM 1997-12-12

  - Attempted to speed up sidedef texture display (without much success).
  - Oops! I realized that unlike what I wrote on 1997-11-30, Doom II
    support is still not complete. The "linedef type" dialog doesn't let
    you enter new linedef types (turbo door, etc.) and the "thing type"
    dialog doesn't let you enter new thing types (mercury lamp, etc.).
    Unless you know the type number by heart, of course.

  DEU BUGS FIXED :
  - Fixed old DEU bug that triggered "Error reading from file" when
    trying to display new textures. Yade doesn't need the -deu option of
    Deutex anymore.

  Sent to JVDV (no report).
  Sent to JRR (said it "seems stable").

AYM 1997-12-20

  - Added brightening or darkening of selected sectors.

  Sent to JVDV.

AYM 1998-02-07

  - Added "..." where needed in "Misc operations" menus.
  - Added 1 extra magnification step (x8).
  - Bounds for grid step are now customizable (gridmin & gridmax)
  - Added logging of time spent editing.
  - Added setting of linedef length (by moving either vertex).
  - Improved memory consumption (about 20 kB less than DEU 5.21). I did
    this simply by improving the overlay granularity.
  - Added parameters game= (-g), iwad1= (-i1) and iwad2= (-i2).
  - Thing types, linedef types and sector types are now defined in the
    .ygd file instead of being hard-coded.
  - You can now use Doom II thing types and v1.666 linedef types.
  - The "thing type" dialog : what was called a class is now called a
    group. If you press Esc from within a thing group, you return to the
    group list. Groups are more finely defined than in DEU.
  - The "linedef type" dialog : if you press Esc from within a linedef
    type group, you return to the group list. Groups are more finely
    defined than in DEU.
  - Things colours : teleport exits are now green like player starts,
    monsters are normal red, not bright red and keys are pink.
  - Removed arbitrary limitations on the value of the following fields :
    thing type, linedef type, linedef tag, sector type, sector tag. All
    can now be entered over the full range [-32768, +32768]. Well,
    actually [-32749, +32749] because of the input routine.
  
  BUG FIXES :
  - Fixed the stupid bug in the "CREATE" command.
  - Put back in one of the "superimposed linedefs" checking that I had
    #ifdef'd out on 1997-07-17 and forgotten to un-#ifdef. Sorry for that.
  - A sidedef is not deleted anymore if there still is a linedef that
    uses it. This was an issue when deleting a linedef created by
    duplication.

  DEU BUGS FIXED :
  - The numeric keypad can now be used in menus.
  
  Sent to JVDV.

AYM 1998-02-13

  - Added shift-F1 in picture viewer to save image to a file.
  - Added indication of size when viewing sprites.
  - Added display of sector headroom (ceiling-floor).
  - Removed 5 more arbitrary limits (amount to raise or lower sectors
    by, sector floor and ceiling height, sidedef x- and y-offset).

  BUG FIXES :
  - Fixed the screen shot bug (in the 1998-02-07 release, shift-F1 hangs).
    Apparently the gifsave library doesn't like to be linked as an
    overlay.
  - Pressing Esc after "Raise or lower sectors" or "Brighten or darken
    sectors" now works. I had forgotten that, in C, "==" has a higher
    precedence than "&", grr...
    
  Sent to BD (reported no bug).
  Sent to JK.
  Sent to JRR.
  Sent to JVDV.

AYM 1998-02-14

  - Rebuilt gifsave with -Y and overlaid it again. Gain : 3 kB.
  - To make it easier to edit crowded areas at high zoom factors,
    limited the apparent size of vertices and linedef arrows to what it
    is at zoom factor 1/1.
  - Optimization : when drawing the map, now avoids to draw off-screen
    things and vertexes. It's still slow :-(

  - Added substitution of sidedef and sector texture.
  (not finished as of 1998-05-25)

AYM 1998-06-03 (after sending YADE8603.ZIP to Ben)

  - More optimization ; when drawing the map, now avoids to draw
    off-screen linedefs. This one did speed things up :-). Also avoid to
    call SetColor() unnecessarily.
  - Added ^L to force redraw.

Yadex 1.0.0 (AYM 1998-12-26)

  - Renamed as Yadex to avoid confusion with Yet Another Diagram Editor.
  - Added magic string to configuration file.
  - Added magic string to game definition file.

  - Platform: ported to X (plain Xlib). This version is not available
    for DOS.
  - Platform: now works on big-endian machines.
  - Platform: removed several DOS-isms from file name handling code.

  - Loading pwads: implemented standard directories. If the pwad to load
    is in one of the standard directories (or a subdirectory) you don't
    have to type the whole name.
  - Loading pwads: added standard directories and made the messages less
    verbose for pwads that contain patches (PP_START/PP_END).

  - Included BSP 2.3
  - If a wad file has been changed and saved, remind the user to build
    nodes.

  - Game support: Heretic is now supported.
  - Game support: added support for Boom's new thing flags not-in-deathmatch
    and not-in-coop.
  - Game support: added support for Boom's new linedef flag pass-through.
  - Game support: added definitions for Boom's things 5001 and 5002 (point
    pusher and puller).

  - Command line: you don't have anymore to put "-file" or "-pwad" in front
    of pwads names on the command line. E.G. you can type "yadex foo.wad".
  - Command line: deleted a few little-used or DOS-specific options.

  - Prompt: now groks TTYs with a number of lines other than 25.

  - Menu bar and pop-up menus much improved.
  - Info bar: reworked.
  - When prompted to "Press a key to continue", you can now also press
    the left mouse button.
  - Grid: the grid step can now adapt automatically as you zoom in/out.
  - Grid: whether dragging is snapped to grid is now independent of whether
    the grid is shown or not (added flags grid_snap and grid_shown).
  - Changed the welcome message (a.k.a. "reminder").
  - Added an "About Yadex..." window.
  - Added finer-grained confirmation options.
  - General editing: you can now scroll the map further from the centre
    of the level.
  - Technical: replaced occurences of "x==TRUE" and "x==FALSE"
    by "x" and "!x".
  - Technical: replaced occurences of "x=TRUE" and "x=FALSE"
    by "x=1" and "x=0".
  - Added ['] to re-centre the window around the centre of the map.
  - Added [`] to re-centre the window around the centre of the map
    and adjust the zoom so that the map fills the screen.
  - Added [&] to show things and vertices numbers.
  - Autoscroll: scroll speed is now progressive.
  - Autoscroll: easier to use near the top of the window.
  - [Left], [Right], [Up], [Down] do nothing.
  - [Space] does not toggle move fast/slow anymore; it toggles between
    nominal zoom and x 4.
  - Highlighting of things, vertices and linedefs much improved.
  - Don't copy SEGS, SSECTORS, NODES, REJECT and BLOCKMAP from the original
    file anymore when the map has changed. Makes smaller .wad files. Nice
    for archival.
  - Added environment variable YADEX_GAME.
  - Dragging objects is now done with the left mouse button instead of the
    right button.
  - Editing object properties is now done by double-clicking on the object.
  - Selection and drag-and-drop have changed a lot.
  - Selection box: removed the -a (addselbox) option. Whether the selection
    box is additive or not is now controlled by the user (with [Ctrl]).
  - Sprite viewer: sprites are now centred.

  - Linedef info: shortened flags names to one character.
  - Linedef info: a missing normal texture on a 1-sided linedef is now
    flagged in red.
  - Linedefs copy: you now have the choice between duplicating
    the sidedefs too and reusing the same sidedefs. DEU left the new
    linedefs sidedef-less and, so far, Yadex used to reuse the same
    sidedefs.
  - Linedefs: added function to "unlink" sidedefs.
  - Linedefs: dragging linedefs is much faster than before.
  - Linedefs: can now set/toggle/clear flags by pressing [a],[b] or [c].

  - Sectors: in the object info window, added display of floor and ceiling
    height delta with respect to previous sector.
  - Sectors: in the object info window, added display of floor and ceiling
    texture.
  - Sectors: dragging sectors is much faster than before.

  - Things: now drawn as squares so that it's easier to see whether they
    are stuck in a wall or another thing. And you don't have to highlight
    them to see their angle. Note: the old shape is still available by
    #defining ROUND_THINGS.
  - Things: changed the colours again. Tried to make important things
    stand out and conversely. Bonuses are now dark green and player/
    deathmatch start bright green. Keys are magenta. Decoration is
    dim blue instead of white. Unknown objects are cyan instead of
    white. Weapons are orange instead of brownish. Heretic sound source
    things and Boom point pushers are dim turquoise-ish.
  - Things: the sprite is now shown in the object info window.
  - Things: can now set/toggle/clear flags by pressing [a],[b] or [c].

  - Vertices: deciding whether a vertex is on a linedef is now done on the
    distance in pixels, not in map units. So you can now work on very fine
    details (E.G. vertices only 2 map units away) provided that the zoom
    factor is high enough.

  DEU BUGS FIXED :
  - Removed dereferencing of NULL pointer in ParseCommandLineOptions().
  - Fixed minor glitch in texture viewer that showed with BIGDOOR7, SKY1,
    TEKWALL1, TEKWALL5 and others.
  - When highlighting a sector, compared
    SideDefs[LineDef[n].sidedef1].sector with ObjNum even though .sector
    was -1. Somehow it always tested false.
  - "Check textures names": the name of the offending texture is now
    printed correctly even if it is 8 characters long.
  - "Check textures names": if you fixed a missing texture, the editor
    was not made aware that you had made changes to the level.
  - Unused sectors are not selected anymore.
  - Changing the preferences could overwrite other variables.
  - InputNameFromListWithFunc() used to segfault if you pressed [page
    down] on a list shorter than (listdisp + 1) elements.
  - Removed segfault during fatal_error() on failure to open the iwad.
  - Removed segfault in AlignTexturesX().

Yadex 1.0.1 (AYM 1999-01-02)

  - Fixed segfault on trying to edit MAPnm in Doom/Heretic mode or EnMm in
    Doom II mode.
  - Split linedefs and sector: new linedef now goes from 1 to 2 and not the
    other way around.
  - Added scrolling with the arrow keys.
  - [Page-up], [Page-down], [Home] and [End] now scroll one page at a time.
  - New variable autoscroll to disable autoscrolling.
  - New variables autoscroll_amp and autoscroll_edge to tweak autoscrolling.
  - New shortcut [x] to "Split linedef (insert new vertex)".
  - New shortcut [w] to "Split linedefs and sector".
  - New sections "Moving around" and "Other credits" in the user's guide.
  - New prompt command "make_gimp_palette" to generate a gimp palette
    file from PLAYPAL.
  - Bumped configuration file version# to 2.

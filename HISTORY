Yadex 1.1.0 (1999-08-22)

     * BSP: Included Colin Phipps' [1]fix for the bugs in
       [2]bsp23bug.zip.
     * BSP: Renamed the executable and the man page as ybsp, to avoid
       having Yadex and Xwadtools overwrite each other's BSP.
     * BSP: The whirling baton is now disabled if stderr is not a TTY.
       This is the same thing Udo Munk did for [3]Xwadtools' BSP with the
       -noprog option except that here it's automatic.
     * BSP: Made the man page spell out exactly which version of BSP this
       is.
     * BSP: Inserted notice in the banner that this is the version that
       comes with Yadex. In the online help, replaced "TMP.WAD" by the
       correct "tmp.wad".
     * Building: Fixed compilation error on line 44 of bitvec.h.
     * Code: Removed CR characters that remained in some of the source
       files.
     * Code: New function DrawScreenString(). Began to use it instead of
       DrawScreenText(). This should squash some latent bugs, for example
       regarding flat and texture names containing percent signs (%).
     * Code: Fixed constness warnings in cfgfile.cc.
     * Code: Replaced most occurrences of hard-coded 8 by one of
       WAD_NAME, WAD_FLAT_NAME, WAD_PIC_NAME and WAD_TEX_NAME.
     * Code: New directives level_format and level_name in the YGD files.
       As a result, been able to remove most tests on specific values of
       the game parameter.
     * Doc: Too many changes and additions to list. Since the last
       release, the HTML doc has doubled in size (from 80 kB to 160 kB).
       Added a dozen of screenshots.
     * Doc: In an attempt to make it easier to find what you're looking
       for, I've split the doc in a larger number of files, referred to
       by a top level index.html.
     * Doc: Moved the HTML doc and the man pages to the doc/ directory,
       so as not to clutter the base directory too much.
     * Doc: Man pages: the first argument of the .TH macro (the name) is
       now all caps since that's what (almost) everybody else does.
     * Editing: Autoscroll is now off by default -- use "autoscroll =
       true" in yadex.cfg if you want it back.
     * Editing: New bindings [e] and [Ctrl][e] to select all linedefs
       that belong to the same non-forked path.
     * Editing: New bindings [E] and [Ctrl][Shift][e] to select all
       single-sided linedefs that belong to the same non-forked path.
     * Editing: New functions to flip and mirror linedefs, sectors,
       things and vertices.
     * Editing: Fixed the "string art" bug. That was a subtle bug that
       happened only as a result of a rare chain of events. The recipe to
       it is to render a vertex unused (for example by deleting all the
       linedefs that use it), save the level, make a change that does not
       call for a rebuilding of the nodes (for example, moving a thing or
       changing an attribute of a sector), save the level, quit and load
       again. At that point, a nice surprise awaits you: the linedefs are
       all entangled (hence the name). Spectacular, and even beautiful,
       but also very annoying if you don't have a backup copy of your
       level.
       This is the same bug I thought I had fixed in Yadex 1.0.0_alpha3.
       In fact, I had cut one of the paths that led to it but the bug
       itself was still there. It reappeared in february 1999.
     * Editing: Fixed an old DEU bug where you sometimes couldn't select
       a newly created sector to the west of the level until you saved.
     * Editing: It's now possible to toggle linedef flags 8-15 and to
       specify linedef flags field values greater than 511.
     * Editing: It's now possible to set/clear/toggle things flags 7-15.
     * Editing: Made the Not-enough-player-starts and
       Not-enough-deathmatch-start dialogs on saving more intuitive (it
       was about time).
     * Editing: New function "Exchange objects numbers".
     * Editing: Things types are now displayed in decimal, not in
       hexadecimal. Other minor cosmetic changes.
     * Editing: The focus-on-object function now works much better. It
       does not land off-target or zoom in excessively anymore.
       Superimposed things and sectors containing other sectors or not
       containing their own centre don't confuse it anymore. It's still
       fooled by unclosed sectors, though.
     * Editing: Changed the meaning of [q]. It used to save and quit. Now
       it just quits (same thing as [Esc]).
     * Editing: The edit command can now edit levels of any name. If you
       had a wad with a level named "FOO" in it, you could edit that
       level by typing "edit foo". In case you're wondering, no there's
       no practical application to this (beyond experimenting).
     * Editing: Reminder to build nodes: the message is now more
       specific.
     * Editing: Command mode: typing ^D at the prompt now works.
     * Editing: Insert linedef and split sector: the new linedef now goes
       from the first selected vertex to the second and not the other way
       around.
     * Editing: Insert linedef and split sector: does not loop forever
       anymore if there are forks in the edge of the sector (for example
       like when trying to split between vertices 283 and 278 of MAP01 of
       Doom II).
     * Editing: [n], [p], [>] and [<] now move the view so that the
       object to highlight is under the pointer.
     * Editing: The messages displayed when loading pwads are more
       compact (several lumps are printed on the same line and groups of
       sprites are collapsed). The end marker for groups of flats,
       patches and sprites is now printed.
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : added bindings [Ctrl][u] and
       [Ctrl][w] to erase to start of line, [Ctrl][f] and [Ctrl][v] to
       page down and [Ctrl][b] to page up.
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : added bindings [Ctrl][PgUp]
       and [Ctrl][PgDn] to move to top and bottom of list, because [Home]
       and [End] will eventually cease to be available for that (they
       will be bound to SOL and EOL).
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : made [Up] and [Down] work
       even when there are duplicate names.
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : InputNameFromListWithFunc()
       is now genuinely case insensitive. The positioning in the list of
       names is now correct, even if the name given is lower-case.
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : reduced flickering (still
       room for improvement, though).
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : the current name was way too
       dim if not in the list. Fixed.
     * Editing: Flat/sprite/texture viewer : made image window 320x200
       instead of 256x128.
     * Editing: Sprite viewer : new bindings [Ctrl][n] and [Ctrl][p] to
       go to start of next/previous group of sprites.
     * Editing: Sprite viewer : fixed display bug.
     * Editing: Spectres now look more like spectres.
     * Editing: Confirm-or-cancel dialogs: more intuitive. You can now
       confirm with [y] or [Return] and cancel with [n] or [Esc]. All
       other keys are ignored (previously, [y] confirmed and all other
       keys cancelled). Expose events are now handled (previously they
       were ignored).
     * Editing: Some abnormal conditions that used to trigger fatal
       errors now just cause a message error to be printed. The current
       operation is aborted but not the whole program anymore.
     * Game/wad: Fixed segfault on levels containing a thing of type 0
       (like Eternal MAP25 and some Final Doom maps).
     * Game/wad: When reading a level from a wad, now verifies that the
       SECTORS, THINGS, VERTEXES, LINEDEFS and SIDEDEFS lumps have
       correct sizes and that sidedefs, sectors and vertices references
       are correct.
     * Game/wad: Final Doom : should be supported now. Yadex does not
       assume anymore that F1_START is always present, which caused it to
       segfault on either or both Final Doom iwads.
     * Game/wad: Heretic : added sprite names for 58 thing types.
     * Game/wad: Hexen : added very partial support (-g hexen). You can
       edit levels but not save them. Hexen-specific linedef and things
       fields are ignored, and so is the BEHAVIOR lump. Most definitions
       are missing.
     * Game/wad: Strife : added partial support (-g strife). Yadex now
       knows about the translucent linedef flag and the new sector types.
       Still missing : the new things flags, most things types and
       linedefs types. Anybody wants to work on strife.ygd ?
     * Game/wad: MBF : supported. Yadex now knows about the friendly
       thing flag, thing type 888 (Dog) and linedef types 271 and 272
       (transfer sky texture).
     * Game/wad: Doom press release pre-beta : supported (-g doompr).
       Added support for the PR picture format and the definitions for
       things 2016 (evil sceptre) and 2017 (unholy bible).
     * Game/wad: Doom alpha : read-only support (-g
       alpha02|alpha04|alpha05). Added support for the alpha picture
       format, the TEXTURES lump, the different level format and the
       incompatible level names (E1M10 through E1M13).
     * Game/wad: Added support for FF_START/FF_END in addition of
       FF_START/F_END. As a result, Yadex does not barf anymore on
       basilica.wad (but issue a warning). F?_START is not supported
       anymore ; it has to be FF_START.
     * Game/wad: Made "Post too long. Wad file might be corrupt" a
       warning, not a fatal error anymore.
     * Game/wad: New directives picture_format, texture_format and
       texture_lump in the YGD files, to support Doom alpha and Doom PR.
     * Misc: New command make_palette_ppm to generate a raw PPM file
       containing all the colours of the palette.
     * Misc: Cosmetic changes in the prompt and character mode interface.
     * Misc: make_gimp_palette : the generated palette files now include
       RGB values in the comments.
     * Misc: Removed from the menus the functions that were not
       implemented (File->Print, Edit->Find, View->3D preview).
     * Misc: Failure to load the specified X font is not a fatal error
       anymore.
     * Misc: New command line options --help and --version.
     * Platform: Removed dependency on nanosleep(), strcasecmp() and
       strncasecmp(). Thanks to Udo Munk for pointing out that
       nanosleep() is not always available.
     * Platform: Now compiles with other compilers than GCC/EGCS without
       modifying the makefile.
     * Platform: New parameter idle_sleep_ms to set the time in ms
       between polls of the X server when the input queue is empty.
     * Platform: Previously, if the CPU and the X server had different
       endiannesses and the screen depth was more than 8 bits, sprites,
       flats and textures were displayed with wrong colours. This is now
       fixed.
     * Platform: The build, group, insert and save commands should now
       work correctly on big-endian machines.
     * Platform: The bell has been resurrected on X.
     * Platform: Should now compile on X11R5 systems (to be verified).
       Thanks to Udo Munk for the fix.
       
Yadex 1.0.1 (1999-01-02)

     * Doc: New sections "Moving around" and "Other credits" in the
       user's guide.
     * Editing: Split linedefs and sector: new linedef now goes from 1 to
       2 and not the other way around.
     * Editing: Added scrolling with the arrow keys.
     * Editing: [Pgup], [Pgdn], [Home] and [End] now scroll one page at a
       time.
     * Editing: New variable autoscroll to disable autoscrolling.
     * Editing: New variables autoscroll_amp and autoscroll_edge to tweak
       autoscrolling.
     * Editing: New shortcut [x] to "Split linedef (insert new vertex)".
     * Editing: New shortcut [w] to "Split linedefs and sector".
     * Misc: Fixed segfault on trying to edit MAPnm in Doom/Heretic mode
       or EnMm in Doom II mode.
     * Misc: New prompt command make_gimp_palette to generate a gimp
       palette file from PLAYPAL.
     * Misc: Bumped configuration file version# to 2.
       
Yadex 1.0.0 (1998-12-26)

     * Code: Moved the source files to a subdirectory.
     * Doc: A few additions in the user's guide
     * Editing: Fixed buglet in positioning of newly copied objects.
     * Game/wad: Game support: added definitions for Boom's things 5001
       and 5002 (point pusher and puller).
     * Misc: Added reminder to build nodes after making changes.
     * Misc: Added magic string to configuration file.
     * Misc: Added magic string to game definition file.
       
Yadex 1.0.0_alpha3 (1998-12-23)

     * Doc: A few additions/corrections in the hacker's guide.
     * Editing: Fixed spectacular corruption of linedefs (string art bug)
       that occurred if all you did during a given session was deleting
       vertices.
       
Yadex 1.0.0_alpha2 (1998-12-22)

     * BSP: Included BSP 2.3 (thanks to Lee Killough).
     * Doc: Improved user's guide.
     * Editing: Added new commands [a], [b] and [c] to set, toggle and
       clear things and linedefs flags.
       
Yadex 1.0.0_alpha1 (1998-12-17)

     * Code: Removed dereferencing of NULL pointer in
       ParseCommandLineOptions() (DEU).
     * Code: Replaced occurrences of "x==TRUE" and "x==FALSE" by "x" and
       "!x".
     * Code: Replaced occurrences of "x=TRUE" and "x=FALSE" by "x=1" and
       "x=0".
     * Command-line: You don't have anymore to put "-file" or "-pwad" in
       front of pwads names on the command line. E.G. you can type "yadex
       foo.wad".
     * Command-line: Deleted a few little-used or DOS-specific options.
     * Editing: Menu bar and pop-up menus much improved.
     * Editing: Info bar reworked.
     * Editing: When prompted to "Press a key to continue", you can now
       also press the left mouse button.
     * Editing: Grid: the grid step can now adapt automatically as you
       zoom in/out.
     * Editing: Grid: whether dragging is snapped to grid is now
       independent of whether the grid is shown or not (added flags
       grid_snap and grid_shown).
     * Editing: Added finer-grained confirmation options.
     * Editing: General editing: you can now scroll the map further from
       the centre of the level.
     * Editing: Added ['] to re-centre the window around the centre of
       the map.
     * Editing: Added [`] to re-centre the window around the centre of
       the map and adjust the zoom so that the map fills the screen.
     * Editing: Added [&] to show things and vertices numbers.
     * Editing: Autoscroll: scroll speed is now progressive.
     * Editing: Autoscroll: easier to use near the top of the window.
     * Editing: [Left], [Right], [Up], [Down] do nothing.
     * Editing: [Space] does not toggle move fast/slow anymore; it
       toggles between nominal zoom and x 4.
     * Editing: Highlighting of things, vertices and linedefs much
       improved.
     * Editing: Dragging objects is now done with the left mouse button
       instead of the right button.
     * Editing: Editing object properties is now done by double-clicking
       on the object.
     * Editing: Selection and drag-and-drop have changed a lot.
     * Editing: Selection box: removed the -a (addselbox) option. Whether
       the selection box is additive or not is now controlled by the user
       (with [Ctrl]).
     * Editing: Sprite viewer: sprites are now centred.
     * Editing: Linedef info: shortened flags names to one character.
     * Editing: Linedef info: a missing normal texture on a 1-sided
       linedef is now flagged in red.
     * Editing: Linedefs copy: you now have the choice between
       duplicating the sidedefs too and reusing the same sidedefs. DEU
       left the new linedefs sidedef-less and, so far, Yadex used to
       reuse the same sidedefs.
     * Editing: Linedefs: added function to "unlink" sidedefs.
     * Editing: Linedefs: dragging linedefs is much faster than before.
     * Editing: Sectors: in the object info window, added display of
       floor and ceiling height delta with respect to previous sector.
     * Editing: Sectors: in the object info window, added display of
       floor and ceiling texture.
     * Editing: Sectors: dragging sectors is much faster than before.
     * Editing: Things: now drawn as squares so that it's easier to see
       whether they are stuck in a wall or another thing. And you don't
       have to highlight them to see their angle. Note: the old shape is
       still available by defining ROUND_THINGS at compile-time.
     * Editing: Things: changed the colours again. Tried to make
       important things stand out and conversely. Bonuses are now dark
       green and player/ deathmatch starts bright green. Keys are
       magenta. Decoration is dim blue instead of white. Unknown objects
       are cyan instead of white. Weapons are orange instead of brownish.
       Heretic sound source things and Boom point pushers are dim
       turquoise-ish.
     * Editing: Things: the sprite is now shown in the object info
       window.
     * Editing: Vertices: deciding whether a vertex is on a linedef is
       now done on the distance in pixels, not in map units. So you can
       now work on very fine details (E.G. vertices only 2 map units
       away) provided that the zoom factor is high enough.
     * Editing: Fixed minor glitch in texture viewer that showed with
       BIGDOOR7, SKY1, TEKWALL1, TEKWALL5 and others (DEU).
     * Editing: When highlighting a sector, compared
       SideDefs[LineDef[n].sidedef1].sector with ObjNum even though
       .sector was -1. Somehow it always tested false (DEU).
     * Editing: "Check textures names": the name of the offending texture
       is now printed correctly even if it is 8 characters long (DEU).
     * Editing: "Check textures names": if you fixed a missing texture,
       the editor was not made aware that you had made changes to the
       level (DEU).
     * Editing: Unused sectors are not selected anymore (DEU).
     * Editing: Changing the preferences could overwrite other variables
       (DEU).
     * Editing: InputNameFromListWithFunc() used to segfault if you
       pressed [Pgdn] on a list shorter than (listdisp + 1) elements
       (DEU).
     * Editing: Removed segfault in AlignTexturesX() (DEU).
     * Game/wad: Heretic is now supported.
     * Game/wad: Added support for Boom's new thing flags
       not-in-deathmatch and not-in-coop.
     * Game/wad: Added support for Boom's new linedef flag pass-through.
     * Misc: Renamed as Yadex to avoid confusion with Yet Another Diagram
       Editor.
     * Misc: Loading pwads: implemented standard directories. If the pwad
       to load is in one of the standard directories (or a subdirectory)
       you don't have to type the whole name.
     * Misc: Loading pwads: added standard directories and made the
       messages less verbose for pwads that contain patches
       (PP_START/PP_END).
     * Misc: Removed segfault during fatal_error() on failure to open the
       iwad (DEU).
     * Misc: The prompt now groks TTYs with a number of lines other than
       25.
     * Misc: Changed the welcome message (a.k.a. "reminder").
     * Misc: Added an "About Yadex..." window.
     * Misc: Don't copy SEGS, SSECTORS, NODES, REJECT and BLOCKMAP from
       the original file anymore when the map has changed. Makes smaller
       wad files. Nice for archival.
     * Misc: Added environment variable YADEX_GAME.
     * Platform: Ported to X (plain Xlib). This version is not available
       for DOS.
     * Platform: Now works on big-endian machines.
     * Platform: Removed several DOS-isms from file name handling code.

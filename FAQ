Compilation problems

   warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
          Not a problem. GCC is over-sensitive to signedness mismatches.
          
   In sanity.cc,
          warning: decimal integer constant is so large that it is
          unsigned 
          Not a problem. It's a bug in GCC.
          
   c++: command not found
          Are you sure you have a C++ compiler ? If not, install one. If
          you do have one, find out how it's called and change the "CXX
          =" line in GNUmakefile accordingly.
          
   X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory
          Are you sure you have the Xlib headers ? If not, install them.
          If you already have them, then find out where they are and
          change the "X11INCLUDEDIR =" line in GNUmakefile accordingly.
          
   The compiler chokes on the Xlib headers
          This happens on Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.95.2. Oliver Kraus says
          that the solution is to add "-fpermissive" to "CXXFLAGS =" in
          GNUmakefile.
          
   /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `recv'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `connect'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `socket'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `setsockopt'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `shutdown'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to
          `gethostbyname'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to
          `getservbyname'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `getpeername'
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `getsockname'
          This happens with QNX 6 and other Unices. Add "-lsocket" to
          "LDFLAGS =" in GNUmakefile.
          
   I have GCC 3.0 and Yadex 1.5.1 doesn't compile
          Get Yadex 1.5.2 or later.
          
   I have GCC 2.96 and Yadex 1.5.0 doesn't compile
          Get Yadex 1.5.1 or later.
          
   I have GCC 2.7 and I get lots of errors
          GCC 2.7 is a very old compiler, it does not implement the
          current C++ standard and I don't support it. If you must, try
          applying patch/gcc-2.7.diff that's included in the archive but
          don't complain to me if it doesn't work.
          
   I have EGCS 1.1.2 / SuSE 6.2 and I get
          "no matching function for call to `menu_c::menu_c (...)'"
          Apparently, there is a bug in certain EGCS 1.1.2 installations
          that makes them choke on src/editloop.cc. I know no workaround.
          I'd suggest that you try to get a fix from your distributor or
          use another compiler. EGCS 1.0.3, EGCS 1.1.1 and GCC 2.95.2 are
          known to work.
          
   Yadex 1.3.1 doesn't compile
          There's a thinko in the makefile. It's fixed in version 1.3.2.
          
   Yadex 1.1.0 doesn't compile
          In src/infobar.cc, lines 48 and 49, replace
          
  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value 
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value

          by
          
  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };

   Yadex 1.0.1 doesn't compile
          In src/vector.h, delete line 44 ("return this;") and compile
          again.
          
Misc.

   I don't have an iwad
          You can download certain iwads for free ;
          
          + [1]Doom 1.8 shareware iwad
          + [2]Heretic shareware version
          + [3]Hexen demo

   What about a 3D preview ?
          Unless I suddenly become interested in 3D graphics, that is not
          going to happen. Besides, I suspect that a better and easier
          way to achieve what you're after might be to implement a
          reload-level in your favourite Doom port.
          
   Yadex is slow, particularly when dragging objects
          Yes. I plan to replace the current implementation (pixmap) by
          drawing directly to the window. The difficulty lies in making
          that without generating a lot of flicker. In the meantime, try
          the -P option.
          
   How many people use Yadex ?
          I don't know for sure. Each new release gets a few hundred
          downloads.
          
   Why didn't you use <insert speaker's favourite toolkit> ?
          I used plain Xlib and not a toolkit for several reasons.
          Firstly, I wanted to learn Xlib. Secondly, I reckoned it would
          be easier to translate the existing BGI calls to Xlib than to
          some higher level toolkit. Thirdly, I feared that depending on
          a toolkit would hurt portability.

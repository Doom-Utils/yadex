<p>The preferred place to put a question about Yadex is the <a
href="contact.html#list_yadex"><code>yadex</code></a> mailing
list.  Alternatively, you can mail the <a
href="contact.html#maintainer">maintainer</a> (me). I'll be
happy to help you if I can. Just be nice with me by not making
me answer the same questions over and over. Many common
questions are already answered in the documentation.

<p>General Doom editing questions are better answered on <a
href="news:rec.games.computer.doom.editing">
<code>rec.games.computer.doom.editing</code></a> or in one of
the many fine Doom editing tutorials and books (see the <a
href="editing_docs.html">list</a>).

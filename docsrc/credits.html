		<h2>DEU</h2>

<p>Yadex is derived from DEU 5.21 that was written by Raphaël
Quinet, Brendon Wyber and others. I am deeply indebted to them
as, if they had not written DEU 5.21 and, more importantly, had
not kindly released the source code, Yadex wouldn't exist.

<p>Here are the credits from the DEU 5.21 documentation&nbsp;:

<p><pre>* Everybody at id Software for making such great games!

* Brendon Wyber                   (b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz)

     New interface (mouse, menus, etc).
     Ability to edit Vertices, Linedefs, Sidedefs, Sectors, and last
     but certainly not least an AUTOMATIC NODES BUILDER.
     Even if I rewrote nearly 90% of the code, this editor still has its
     strong DEU roots... :-)

* Matt Fell                       (matt.burnett@acebbs.com)
     Author of the great Unofficial Doom Specs.  Making this program

	<h2>What's in a name ?</h2>

<p>In its previous incarnation, Yadex was named Yade, which
means Yet Another Doom Editor. I later realized that this name
was already taken (by Yet Another Diagram Editor). I decided
that the easiest way to remedy this would be to append a fifth
letter. I chose "<i>x</i>" because it has a neat regular shape
and because it evokes both Unix and X and therefore conveys an
important political message ;-).

<p>The right way to typeset it is with a capital Y and the rest
in lower case. Think of it as of a proper noun.

	<h2>Compilation problems</h2>

<dl>
  <p><dt><strong>c++: command not found</strong>
  <dd>Are you sure you have a C++ compiler&nbsp;? If not, install one. If you
    do have one, find out how it's called and change the "<code>CXX =</code>"
    line in <code>GNUmakefile</code> accordingly.

  <p><dt><strong>X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory</strong>
  <dd>Are you sure you have the Xlib headers&nbsp;? If not, install them. If
    you already have them, then find out where they are and change the
    "<code>X11INCLUDEDIR =</code>" line in <code>GNUmakefile</code>
    accordingly.

  <p><dt><strong>I have GCC 2.7 and I get lots of errors</strong>
  <dd>GCC 2.7 is a very old compiler, it does not implement the current C++
    standard and I don't support it. If you must, try applying
    <code>patch/gcc-2.7.diff</code> that's included in the archive but don't
    complain to me if it doesn't work.

  <p><dt><strong>I have EGCS&nbsp;1.1.2 / SuSE&nbsp;6.2 and I get
    <br>"no matching function for call to `menu_c::menu_c (...)'"</strong>
  <dd>Apparently, there is a bug in certain EGCS 1.1.2 installations that makes
    them choke on <code>src/editloop.cc</code>. I know no workaround. I'd
    suggest that you try to get a fix from your distributor or use another
    compiler.  EGCS&nbsp;1.0.3, EGCS&nbsp;1.1.1 and GCC&nbsp;2.95.2 are known
    to work. 

  <p><dt><strong>Yadex 1.3.1 doesn't compile</strong>
  <dd>There's a thinko in the makefile. It's fixed in version 1.3.2.

  <p><dt><strong>Yadex 1.1.0 doesn't compile</strong>
  <dd>In <code>src/infobar.cc</code>, lines 48 and 49, replace

<pre>  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value 
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value</pre>

by

<pre>  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };</pre> 

  <dt><strong>Yadex 1.0.1 doesn't compile</strong>
  <dd>In <code>src/vector.h</code>, delete line 44 ("<code>return
    this;</code>") and compile again.
</dl>

	<h2>Misc.</h2>

<dl>
  <p><dt><strong>I don't have an iwad</strong>
  <dd>You can download certain iwads for free&nbsp;;
    <ul>
      <li><a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/doom-1.8.wad.gz"
      >Doom 1.8 shareware iwad</a>
      <li><a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/heretic/htic_v12.zip"
      >Heretic shareware version</a>

    </ul>

  <p><dt><strong>How many people use Yadex&nbsp;?</strong>
  <dd>I don't know for sure. Each new release gets a few hundred downloads.

  <p><dt><strong>Why didn't you use &lt;insert speaker's favourite
    toolkit&gt;&nbsp;?</strong>
  <dd>I used plain Xlib and not a toolkit for several reasons. Firstly, I
    wanted to learn Xlib. Secondly, I reckoned that it would be easier to
    translate the existing BGI calls to Xlib than to some higher level toolkit.
    Thirdly, I feared that depending on a toolkit would hurt portability.

    <h2>Compilation issues</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>
	<strong>
	  During configure,
	  <br><code>error: none of (gcc, c89, cc) work, is your PATH set
	  right?</code>
	</strong>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  You need a C compiler to compile Yadex.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you have one but it's not in the path, either fix
	  <code>$$PATH</code> or pass the full pathname to the configure script
	  with the <code>--cc</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure --cc
	  /opt/sfw/bin/gcc</code>").
	</p>

	<p>
	  If it's in the path but it's not called <code>gcc</code> or
	  <code>c89</code> or <code>cc</code>, pass the name to the configure
	  script with the <code>--cc</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure --cc
	  icc</code>").
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>During configure,
	<br><code>error: none of (g++, c++, cxx) work, is your PATH set right?
	</code></strong>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  You need a C++ compiler to compile Yadex.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you have one but it's not in the path, either fix
	  <code>$$PATH</code> or pass the full pathname to the configure script
	  with the <code>--cxx</code> flag (E.G.  "<code>./configure --cxx
	  /opt/sfw/bin/g++</code>").
	</p>

	<p>
	  If it's in the path but it's not called <code>g++</code> or
	  <code>c++</code> or <code>cxx</code>, pass the name to the configure
	  script with the <code>--cxx</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure
	  --cxx icc</code>").
	</p>

      <dt><strong>The compiler chokes on the Xlib headers</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  This happens on Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.95.2. Oliver Kraus says that
	  the solution is to add "<code>-fpermissive</code>" to CXXFLAGS
	  ("<code>./configure --cxxflags -fpermissive</code>").
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `recv'

	</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  This happens with QNX 6 and other Unices. In
	  <code>GNUmakefile</code>, add "<code>-lsocket</code>" after all
	  occurrences of "<code>-lX11</code>".
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Solaris: can't resolve <code>gettimeofday()</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  In <code>GNUmakefile</code>, add "<code>-lrt</code>" after all
	  occurrences of "<code>-lX11</code>".
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>Mac OS X:
	<br><code>al_adigits.o literal C string section (__TEXT,__cstring) does
	not end with a '\0'</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  As far as I can see, the code in Yadex is legal C, and Mac OS X's
	  <code>ld</code> is incorrect in rejecting it. As a workaround, change
	  the size of <code>al_adigits[]</code> from 36 to 37 in
	  <code>al_adigits.c</code> and <code>atclib.h</code>. The real fix is
	  to complain to <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> for selling
	  you a linker that won't link valid C code.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>GCC 3.0: Yadex 1.5.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Get Yadex 1.5.2 or later.
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>GCC 2.96: Yadex 1.5.0 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Get Yadex 1.5.1 or later.
	</p>

      <dt>
        <strong>EGCS&nbsp;1.1.2 / SuSE&nbsp;6.2:
	<br><code>no matching function for call to `menu_c::menu_c (...)'
	</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Apparently, there is a bug in certain EGCS 1.1.2 installations that
	  makes them choke on <code>src/editloop.cc</code>. I know no
	  workaround. I'd suggest that you try to get a fix from your
	  distributor or use another compiler. EGCS&nbsp;1.0.3, EGCS&nbsp;1.1.1
	  and GCC&nbsp;2.95.2 are known to work. 
	</p>

      <dt><strong>GCC 2.7: lots of compilation errors</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  GCC 2.7 is a very old compiler, it does not implement the current C++
	  standard and I don't support it. If you must, try applying
	  <code>patch/gcc-2.7.diff</code> that's included in the archive but
	  don't complain to me if it doesn't work.
	</p>


      <dt>
        <strong>GCC:
	<br><code>warning: comparison between signed and unsigned</code>
	</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  GCC is over-sensitive to signedness mismatches. Don't worry, that
	  won't prevent Yadex from working.
	</p>

      <dt>
        <strong>GCC: In <code>sanity.cc</code>,
	<br><code>warning: decimal integer constant is so large that it is
	unsigned</code></strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Weird as it may sound, the standard says that the lowest value that a
	  signed long can hold is -(2^31). GCC sticks to the party line, never
	  mind that you're on a platform like i386 where <code>LONG_MIN</code>
	  is -(2^31)&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can ignore this warning.
	</p>
      
      <dt>
	<strong>GCC: In <code>sanity.cc</code>,
	<br><code>warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO
	C90</code></strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  This is a new avatar (as of GCC 3.3) of the previous warning. Ignore
	  it.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.3.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  There's a thinko in the makefile. It's fixed in version 1.3.2.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.1.0 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  In <code>src/infobar.cc</code>, lines 48 and 49, replace
	</p>

  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value</pre>

  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };</pre>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.0.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex is slow, particularly when dragging objects</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Yes. I plan to replace the current implementation (pixmap) by drawing
	  directly to the window. The difficulty lies in making that without
	  generating a lot of flicker. In the meantime, try the <code>-P</code>
	  option.

    <h2>Development and contributions</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>What about a 3D preview&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Andrew Apted has written an amazing patch that does exactly that. See
	  the <a href="http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/yadex/">Yadex patch
	  page</a>.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Why didn't you use &lt;insert speaker's favourite
	toolkit&gt;&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  I used plain Xlib and not a toolkit for several reasons. Firstly, I
	  wanted to learn Xlib. Secondly, I reckoned it would be easier to
	  translate the existing BGI calls to Xlib than to some higher level
	  toolkit. Thirdly, I feared that depending on a toolkit would hurt
	  portability.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Why hasn't patch <i>x</i> been integrated&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Adapted from <a
	  href="http://www.freelists.org/archives/yadex/01-2004/msg00009.html">this
	  post</a>&nbsp;:
	</p>

        <p>
	  Maybe the patch is not good enough. Even if it's perfectly good,
	  other reasons could delay or prevent its integration.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The first issue is the cost of reviewing. As a general rule, I don't
	  integrate code without reviewing it. Reviewing code, especially code
	  you have not written and don't understand <em>a priori</em>, is hard
	  work.  In fact, validating code written by someone else can take more
	  time and effort than writing it yourself from scratch.
	</p>

        <p>
	  Reviewing code is also a lot less fun than writing or designing, at
	  least to me. Clearly, your patch better be interesting if it's to be
	  integrated.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The second issue is, surprise surprise, time. I don't have much free
	  time and am not always able and willing to spend it on Yadex. And
	  yes, sometimes a year or more will pass until I find myself with
	  nothing more urgent and motivating to do today than processing your
	  patch.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The third issue is timing. At this point in the development of Yadex,
	  the top priority as I see it is not adding features, it's improving
	  the architecture. Specifically,
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>rewrite the wad directory handling code,
	  <li>replace the level data globals by a Level class,
	  <li>replace <code>EditorLoop()</code> by something sane,
	  <li> modify the game definition code to support includes, alternative
	    sorting methods, and a programmatic access to details of linedef
	    types.
	</ul>

	<p>
	  These changes will bring enormous benefits, directly or indirectly.
	  Undo (which in turn solves the problem of having to confirm every
	  little change). Editing several levels at once.  Doing cut and paste
	  across levels. No more <code>P_START</code>/<code>P_END</code>
	  problems. Better consistency checking. Console mode and
	  multiple-keystroke bindings, which means not having to rack one's
	  brain for a good shortcut anymore, which in turn means it's going to
	  be a lot easier to add functions. Macros. Customisable bindings (and
	  bindings cheat-sheet for free). Better linedef type selector. Mouse
	  tools à la Mac (or Gimp).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Now, most patches I get are about adding features over the exisiting
	  architecture. Desirable as those features may be, they distract me
	  from what I think I should be doing first. They also add to my
	  workload because they add more code that will have to be updated
	  after the rewrites. The patches that touch <code>EditorLoop()</code>
	  are the worst.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The fourth issue is that I have quite a few patches in my to-do list.
	  Maybe yours isn't being processed because others have been submitted
	  earlier and are still waiting for me to look at them.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Sometimes, I'll let a patch jump the queue if it's a no-brainer (E.G.
	  a bug fix), or if its value/cost ratio is high enough (E.G. the 3D
	  preview patch). But, in general, I don't think it would be fair to
	  process submissions in last-in-first-out order.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As a final note, don't take rejection personally. Whether or not a
	  patch gets integrated has a lot more to do with the patch itself and
	  the circumstances than with who submitted it.
	</p>

    <h2>Misc.</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>How many people use Yadex&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  I don't know for sure. Each new release gets a few hundred downloads.

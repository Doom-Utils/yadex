	<h2><a name="introduction">
	1. Introduction</a></h2>

		<h3>Yadex in one paragraph</h3>

<p>Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running
X, including Linux. It supports Doom, Doom II, Ultimate Doom,
Final Doom, Heretic, Doom press release pre-beta and also, in a
more or less limited way, Hexen, Strife and Doom alpha. It is
available under the terms of the GPL.

		<h3><a name="prerequisites">What do I need ?</a></h3>

<p>To compile, install and run this release of Yadex, you need
<ul>
<li>a POSIX-compatible environment (such as Unix),
<li>a C compiler (ISO-compatible),
<li>a C++ compiler (ISO-compatible),
<li>GNU make (it won't work with other flavours of make),
<li>an HTML viewer to read the doc,
<li>a Doom/Doom II/Heretic/Hexen/Strife iwad,
<li>X11R6 or X11R5.
</ul>

<p>More specifically, Yadex expects that
<ul>
<li>the routines in <code>ctype.h</code> accept the range
	<code>CHAR_MIN</code> through <code>UCHAR_MAX</code>,
<li>the C library supports <code>hypot()</code> and at least one
	of <code>nanosleep()</code> and <code>usleep()</code>.
</ul>

		<h4>Iwad</h4>

<p>A shareware Doom or Heretic iwad or a demo Hexen or Strife
iwad is okay but you need a registered iwad if you want to be
able to save your changes.

		<h4>Directories</h4>

<p>Yadex conforms to the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">
FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)</a>.
The installation procedure will try to copy files in the following
directories, creating the directories if they don't exist ;
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/etc</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/man/man6</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games</code>
</ul>
<p>So make sure you have the necessary rights before installing
(or change the makefile).

		<h4>Display</h4>

<p>Yadex uses about 270 different colours. In most cases, on
PseudoColor displays, there aren't that many free colour cells.
So, if it detects a PseudoColor display, Yadex uses a private
colormap so as to get as many free colour cells as possible.
The inconvenient of this method is that, when you're in the
Yadex window, all other windows are displayed with wrong colours
and vice-versa.

<p>What's more, as PseudoColor displays typically have 256
colours (at least on PC), which is less than the number of
colours needed, Yadex might have to assign the same physical
colour to different logical colours. If it happens, it will try
to render the colours of the game accurately at the expense of
the application colours.

<p>Monochrome displays might work but they have not been tested.

<p>Executive summary: if you can, use a TrueColor or DirectColor
display and a depth of more than 8 bits per pixel (E.G. by
launching X with "<code>startx -- -bpp 16</code>").

<p>A 640x480 screen is okay though, of course, a larger display
is better.

	<h3><a name="compiling">Compiling and installing Yadex</a></h3>

See <a href="README"><code>README</code></a>.

<p>Don't forget to tell Yadex where your iwads are by changing
the lines "<code>iwad1&nbsp;=</code>",
"<code>iwad2&nbsp;=</code>" etc. in
<code>/usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg</code>. If there is an iwad you
don't have, you can just comment out the corresponding line.

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2><a name="running">
	2. Running Yadex</a></h2>

		<h3>The command line arguments</h3>

<p>Yadex takes two sorts of command line arguments&nbsp;:
parameters and options. An option is a command line argument
that starts with a "<code>-</code>".

<p>Some options take an argument. The argument must be
separated from the option by some whitespace.
<strong>Constructs like "<code>-othingy</code>" are not
recognized. You have to type "<code>-o thingy</code>".</strong>

<p>The "<code>-file</code>" option takes a variable number of
arguments. It uses all the non-options up to the next option.

<p>The options that take no argument can be negated by using a
"<code>+</code>" instead of a "<code>-</code>". For example,
"<code>+sb</code>" will undo the effect of a
"<code>swap_buttons&nbsp;=&nbsp;true</code>" directive in the
config file.

<p>In general, if you specify the same option more than once,
the last occurrence overrides the previous ones. For example,
"<code>yadex&nbsp;+P&nbsp;-P</code>" is equivalent to
"<code>yadex&nbsp;-P</code>". Similarly,
"<code>yadex&nbsp;-i1&nbsp;foo.wad&nbsp;-i1&nbsp;bar.wad&nbsp;-i1&nbsp;baz.wad</code>"
boils down to "<code>yadex&nbsp;-i1&nbsp;baz.wad</code>".

<p>The "<code>-pwad</code>" (or "<code>-pw</code>") option,
however are additive. Each occurrence will add to the previous
ones. For instance,
"<code>yadex&nbsp;-pwad&nbsp;foo.wad&nbsp;-pwad&nbsp;bar.wad</code>"
is equivalent to "<code>yadex&nbsp;foo.wad&nbsp;bar.wad</code>".

<p>Any command line argument that is not an option is treated as
the name of a pwad to load. You can put as many names of pwads
on the command line as you wish (or none at all). The details
of specifying pwad names are discussed <a
href="#pwads">there</a>.

		<h3>Options</h3>

<p>To know about the command line options that Yadex
understands, type

<p>
<code>$ yadex --help</code>
<p>
You'll get this:
<p>
<pre>
-f  -config_file   <var>string</var>     Config file
-d  -debug                    Debug mode

-w  -width         <var>integer</var>    Initial window width
-z  -zoom          <var>integer</var>    Initial zoom factor
</pre>
<p>You might wonder what the "<code>-file</code>",
"<code>-pw</code>" and "<code>-pwad</code>" options are for
since it's so simple to just put the names of the pwads
on the command line. The answer is that they're only here
for compatibility with previous versions of Yadex/Yade/DEU.
Don't use them. They might go away one day.

		<h3><a name="game">
		Specifying the game for which you want to edit</a></h3>

<p>Yadex can handle several games (Doom, Doom II, Heretic, etc.)
but only one at a time. Unfortunately, that game can't be
changed dynamically. If you want to switch game, you must quit
Yadex and run it again.

<p>By default, the game used is the one specified by the
"<code>game=</code>" directive in the configuration file. If
you want to override the default, use "<code>-g
<var>game</var></code>".

<p>The allowed values for <code><var>game</var></code> are&nbsp;:
<dl>
<dt>"<code>doom</code>"
<dd>Doom and Ultimate Doom (shareware or registered)
<dt>"<code>doom02</code>"
<dd>Doom alpha 0.2
<dt>"<code>doom04</code>"
<dd>Doom alpha 0.4
<dt>"<code>doom05</code>"
<dd>Doom alpha 0.5
<dt>"<code>doom2</code>"
<dd>Doom II and Final Doom
<dt>"<code>doompr</code>"
<dd>Doom press release pre-beta
<dt>"<code>heretic</code>"
<dd>Heretic (shareware or registered)
<dt>"<code>hexen</code>"
<dd>Hexen (demo or commercial)
<dt>"<code>strife</code>"
<dd>Strife 1.1 or later (demo or commercial)
<dt>"<code>strife10</code>"
<dd>Strife 1.0 (demo or commercial)
</dl>

<p>Not all those games are fully supported. For details, see <a
href="#games">there</a>.

		<h3><a name="pwads">
		Specifying the names of pwads to load</a></h3>

<p>When you have to specify the name of a pwad to load, for
example in the <code>r</code> command, or as a command line
argument, you don't always have to spell it all out.

<ul>

<p><li>The <code>.wad</code> extension can be omitted,
it will be added automatically.
For example, specifying the name "<code>foo</code>"
is equivalent to specifying "<code>foo.wad</code>".
An unfortunate consequence of this convention is
that it's impossible to load a wad that would be
really called "<code>foo</code>".
Though, under DOS, you can still work around this limitation
by specifying the name with a trailing dot,
("<code>foo.</code>").

<p><li>The path can sometimes be omitted too, if the
wad is in one of the <dfn>standard directories</dfn>,
or one of their subdirectories.
If no file of the name you specified
is found in the current directory,
Yadex will look for a file of that name
in the standard directories, which are&nbsp;:
<ol>
<li>your home directory,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/</code><var>game</var>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/</code><var>game</var>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/wads</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/wads</code>,
</ol>
(where <var>game</var> is the name of the <a href="#game">game</a>).

<p>On the other hand, if you give an absolute file name, that is
one that begins with a "<code>/</code>", the standard
directories will <em>not</em> be used. Yadex will only try to
open the file of the exact name you specified.

<p>For example, if you type "<code>yadex -g doom2
foo/bar</code>", Yadex will look for the following files in
order&nbsp;:

<ol>
<li><code>~/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/doom2/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/doom2/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/wads/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/wads/foo/bar.wad</code>,
</ol>
and open the first it finds.

<p>But if you type
"<code>yadex&nbsp;-g&nbsp;doom2&nbsp;/foo/bar</code>" (note the
leading slash), Yadex will try to open
"<code>/foo/bar.wad</code>", period.

<p>The philosophy behind those standard directories is
that&nbsp;:

<ul>
<li>a local file overrides a global one,
<li>a game-specific file overrides a non-game-specific one.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Gotcha: those shorthands can only be used when
<em>reading</em> a pwad. When <em>writing</em> to a pwad, you
always have to specify the exact name, with the full path and
extension.

		<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>DOOMWADDIR</code>
<dd>No, <code>DOOMWADDIR</code> is <em>not</em> supported.
Perhaps in another version...

<dt><code>DISPLAY</code>
<dd>Unix only. The name of the X display that Yadex will try to connect to.

<dt><code>YADEX_GAME</code>
<dd>Indicates the game to use.
Overrides the <code>game</code> parameter in the config file,
is overridden by the <code>-g</code> command line option.

</dl>

	<h2><a name="editing">
	3. Editing levels with Yadex</a></h2>

		<h3>Using external textures, flats, etc.</h3>

<p>Like Doom, Yadex accepts the addition and replacement of
resources from a pwad. In general, if the same resource is
defined in several wads, the last definition is used. This is
also true if the same resource is defined several times in the
same wad. It's not recommended that you use lower case names in
your wads; sometimes it's handled but sometimes it's not. So
always use upper-case names.

<dl>

<p><dt>Flats
<dd>New or replacement flats are recognized iff they're placed
between <code>FF_START</code>/<code>F_END</code> or
<code>FF_START</code>/<code>FF_END</code> labels. There can be
any number of <code>FF_START</code>/<code>F_END</code> and
<code>FF_START</code>/<code>FF_END</code> pairs and they don't
have to be in the same pwad. If there are several lumps for the
same flat, the last one is used.

<p><dt>Palette
<dd>If there is a replacement <code>PLAYPAL</code> lump, it's
used. If there are several <code>PLAYPAL</code> lumps, the last
one is used.

<p><dt>Patches
<dd>New or replacement patches are recognized iff they're in the
<code>PNAMES</code> lump. If there are several
<code>PNAMES</code> lumps, the last one is used. If there are
several lumps for the same flat, the last one is used.

<p>There is a bug in the handling of replacement patches:
they're normally expected to be between <code>PP_START</code>
and <code>PP_END</code> but, if they are, Yadex ignores them.
For example, a pwad that contains only the <code>RSKY1</code>
lump will work but a pwad that contains <code>PP_START</code>,
<code>RSKY1</code>, <code>PP_END</code> will not. This will be
fixed in another release.

<p><dt>Sprites
<dd>Neither new nor replacement sprites are recognized. This will
be fixed in another release.

<p><dt>Textures
<dd>New or replacement textures are recognized iff they're in a
<code>TEXTURE1</code> or <code>TEXTURE2</code> lump. If the same
texture happens to be defined in both <code>TEXTURE1</code> and
<code>TEXTURE2</code> (which should not happen), only the
definition in <code>TEXTURE1</code> is used. If there are
several <code>TEXTURE1</code> lumps, the last one is used. If
there are several <code>TEXTURE2</code> lumps, the last one is
used. If it exists, <code>TEXTURE2</code> is always susceptible
to be used, even for games where it's not supposed to exist,
like Doom&nbsp;II.

</dl>

		<h3>Logging of time spent</h3>

<p>If you edit a level from a file and there exists a file in
the same directory with the same name but with the extension
<code>.yl</code>, that file will be used to keep track of the
time you spent editing that level. At the end of the editing
session, Yadex will append a line to the <code>.yl</code> file
with the name of the level and the number of minutes spent on
it.

<p> Note that if the <code>.yl</code> file does not already
exist, it is <em>not</em> created. This is to prevent the
creation of a large number of small useless files when browsing
through a collection of wads. Thus, if you want to enable
logging, you need to manually create the log file first with a
command such as "<code>touch <var>name</var>.yl</code>".

		<h3>The prompt commands</h3>

<p>You can get a summary of the prompt commands
by typing "<code>?</code>" at the Yadex prompt.

		<h3>Moving around</h3>

			<h4>Moving the pointer</h4>

<p>In the X11 version, the only way to do that is to
move the pointer device (i.e. the mouse).

			<h4>Scrolling</h4>

<p>The arrow keys [<kbd>Left</kbd>], [<kbd>Right</kbd>],
[<kbd>Up</kbd>] and [<kbd>Down</kbd>] scroll a little at a time,
by default 10% of the screen/window width or height. You can
change the exact amount by setting the variable
<code>scroll_less</code> in the configuration file.

<p>[<kbd>Page-up</kbd>], [<kbd>Page-down</kbd>],
[<kbd>Home</kbd>] and [<kbd>End</kbd>] scroll more at a time, by
default 90% of the screen/window width or height. You can change
the exact amount by setting the variable
<code>scroll_more</code> in the configuration file.

			<h4>Autoscrolling</h4>

<p>By default, autoscrolling is disabled. You can enable it by
setting <code>autoscroll</code> to <code>true</code> in the
configuration file.

<p>When it is enabled and the pointer is close to the edge of
the screen/window, the map scrolls automatically. The closer you
are to the edge, the faster it scrolls. Autoscrolling is always
disabled near the menu bar items so that the map does not scroll
when you're reaching for the menu.

<p>You can fine tune autoscrolling by changing the variables
<code>autoscroll_amp</code> and <code>autoscroll_edge</code>.

			<h4>Jumping</h4>

<p>I plan to develop a full set-mark/jump-to-mark system similar
to the one in <code>vi</code>, with
<code>m<var>mark-name</var></code>, <code>'<var>mark-name</var></code>
and <code>`<var>mark-name</var></code>.

<p>For the moment, if you press [<kbd>'</kbd>], the map scrolls
so that its centre is at the centre of the screen/window.

<p>If you press [<kbd>`</kbd>], the map scrolls so that its
centre is at the centre of the screen/window and the zoom factor
is adjusted so that the whole map is visible and almost fills
the screen/window.

		<h3>Zooming in and out</h3>

<p>The current zoom factor is shown on the info bar, after the
word "<code>Scale:</code>". It is shown in pixels per map
units. The indication "<code>Scale: 1/2</code>" means that one
pixel of the display corresponds to 2 map units.

<p>You can zoom in by pressing [<kbd>+</kbd>] or [<kbd>=</kbd>]
or the 4th mouse button or by moving the mouse wheel "up".

<p> You can zoom out by pressing [<kbd>-</kbd>] or
[<kbd>_</kbd>] or the 5th mouse button or by moving the mouse
wheel "down".

<p> You can also set the zoom factor directly with the keys
[<kbd>0</kbd>] through [<kbd>9</kbd>].

		<h3>The grid</h3>

<p>The <dfn>grid</dfn> is a square mesh of blue lines in the
background. It's here to help you aligning your objects
correctly with regard to Doom's metrics, which will save you a
lot of textures misalignments.

<p> When you insert or drag objects, they are <dfn><i>snapped to
grid</i></dfn>. That is Yadex prevents you from placing them
off the grid. You can toggle the <code>snap_to_grid</code> flag
by pressing [<kbd>y</kbd>].

<p> The grid step is always a power of 2, E.G. 128, 64, 32, etc.
You can get a finer grid (dividing the grid step by 2) by
pressing [<kbd>g</kbd>]. Conversely, pressing [<kbd>G</kbd>]
multiplies the grid step by 2. If you press [<kbd>g</kbd>] when
the grid step is already at its minimum value, it will be set to
its maximum value. And conversely. The minimum and maximum
values are set in the configuration file with
<code>grid_min</code> and <code>grid_max</code>.

<p> When you change the zoom factor, Yadex automatically changes
the grid step to make it what it thinks is best for the new zoom
factor. If you want to lock the grid step to its current value,
press [<kbd>z</kbd>]. To unlock it, press that key again.

<p> You can hide the grid by pressing [<kbd>h</kbd>] (but this
doesn't disable <code>snap_to_grid</code>). Press that key
again to make the grid visible again.

<p>You can also use [<kbd>H</kbd>] to reset the grid step.

		<h3>Inserting objects</h3>

<p>By pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>], you insert a new object under
the pointer.

<p>The type of the new object is generally determined by the
current mode. That is, if you are in things mode, pressing
[<kbd>Ins</kbd>] will create a new thing. However, this is not
always true, particularly if some objects are already
selected&nbsp;:

<p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in vertices mode and there are two or more
vertices selected, pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>] will insert a
linedef from the first vertex to the second, another one from
the second to the third and so on. That is, a path of linedefs
is created from the first to the last vertex. The path is not
closed.

<li>If you are in linedefs mode and there are selected linedefs,
pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>] will create a new sector and new
sidedefs that point to it and assign them to the linedefs. For
the linedefs that had no first sidedef (whether or not they
already had a second sidedef), the new sidedef is attached as
first sidedef. For the linedefs that had a first sidedef but no
second sidedef, the new sidedef is attached as second sidedef.
If one or more of the selected linedefs already had two
sidedefs, the operation fails. Bug: the side to which the new
sidedef is attached is decided without taking into account the
actual orientation of the linedef.

</ul>

<p>If an object of the same type is highlighted at the moment
you press [<kbd>Ins</kbd>], the properties of the new object are
copied from the highlighted object. In other words, the
highlighted object serves as a "model". Else the properties of
the new object are set to default values.

		<h3>Copying objects</h3>

<p>When you press [<kbd>o</kbd>], the selected or highlighted
object(s) is(are) copied. If only one object has been copied,
the new copy is spawned under the pointer. If several objects
have been copied, the new copies are spawned so that their
centre is under the pointer.

<p>The new copies are spawned selected and everything else is
unselected so that you can easily drag them where you want.

<p>All the properties of the new objects are copied from the
original objects with the notable exception of references. If
you are an OO programmer, think shallow copy vs. deep copy.
Otherwise, read on.

<p>When you copy linedefs, the start and end vertices are copied
too and the new linedefs reference the new vertices instead of
the old ones. The same thing goes for sidedefs, except if the
<code>copy_linedef_reuse_sidedefs</code> flag is true. In that
case, each new linedef uses the same sidedefs as its "model"
did. This is useful when you want to create many similar
structures, E.G. pillars that stand in the same sector. When all
the structures use the same sidedefs, you can change all
structures at once by editing only one of them. Another benefit
of sharing sidedefs is that it makes your wad file somewhat
leaner, since the sidedef, at 30 bytes, is the largest level
object.

<p>However, sharing sidedefs makes impossible to change one
structure independantly of the others. That's where the "unlink
sidedef" function enters. If you select one or more linedefs and
unlink their sidedefs, Yadex makes the necessary duplications so
that none of the sidedefs they use is also used by any other
linedef outside the selection. Thus you can edit your linedefs
freely. The "unlink sidedef" operation is described in detail
<a href="#unlink_sidedefs">there</a>.

<p>Similarly, when you copy sectors, the linedefs, sidedefs and
vertices are duplicated and the new sectors use the copies, not
the original ones. Note that the
<code>copy_linedef_reuse_sidedefs</code> has not effect when
copying sectors; the new linedefs always use new sidedefs, even
if that flag is set.

<p>What about copying things and vertices&nbsp;? Well, those
don't contain references to other objects, so there are no
special precautions to take when duplicating them. Except for
the position, the copy is exactly identical to the original.

		<h3>Deleting objects</h3>

To be written. There is already a concise description in the <a
href="getting_started.html">getting started</a> document.

<br>Basically, use [<kbd>Del</kbd>].

		<h3>Changing the properties of objects</h3>

To be written. There is already a concise description in the <a
href="getting_started.html">getting started</a> document.

<br>Executive summary: use [<kbd>Return</kbd>] and double-click.

		<h3>Moving objects a.k.a. drag-and-drop</h3>

To be written. There is already a concise description in the <a

		<h3>Renumbering objects</h3>

Normally, you don't have to worry very much about the actual
numbers of the linedefs, sectors, sidedefs, things and vertices
you manipulate. You just have to be careful to use the correct
numbers in references but that's all. You don't need to
<em>change</em> the number that a given object bears.

<p>However, for certain things, the <em>relative</em> numbers of
objects matter&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li>if you have several player 1 starts in your level (which is
how the voodoo doll trick is done), it's the lowest-numbered one
that the player incarnates in at level start,

<li>if there are several teleport exits in the same sector, I
think only the lowest-numbered one is used (but I don't know of
any interesting application of this fact),

<li>if there are several superimposed linedefs, the
lowest-numbered one is drawn like it was in front,

<li>BSP's transparent doors need one of the door tracks to be
the lowest-numbered linedef,

<li>certain linedef types apply only to the lowest-numbered of
the tagged sectors (IIRC),

<li>raising stairs use the lowest-numbered linedef.

</ul>

<p>So how do you control the ordering of objects&nbsp;?

			<h4>Exchanging objects numbers</h4>

This function works the same way in all modes. If you select
exactly two objects and press [<kbd>Ctrl-x</kbd>] (or use
"Edit-&gt;Exchange objects numbers") they exchange their
numbers. That is, if the first object had number <var>n1</var>
and the second object had number <var>n2</var>, the first object
in renumbered to <var>n2</var> and the second one to
<var>n1</var>. No other objects are renumbered.

<p>At the same time the numbers are exchanged, all relevant
references are fixed up. That is, if you exchange the numbers of
two vertices, all the linedefs that referred to them are changed
accordingly. And if you exchange the numbers of two sectors, all
the sidedefs that referred to them are fixed. The thing to
remember is that this function leaves the level functionally
identical to what it was before, except of course for the
possible side effects of the renumbering itself.

<p><small>(If you wanted (for some reason I can't imagine) to
exchange the numbers without fixing the references, you could do
it by replacing <code>true</code> by <code>false</code> in the
call to <code>exchange_objects_numbers()</code>.)</small>

		<h3>Selecting objects</h3>

There are several ways to select objects. The simplest is to
click on an object with the left mouse button. By default, when
you do that, all other previously selected objects are
unselected.

<p>If you want to select an object without unselecting
everything else, do the same thing but keep [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]
pressed while you click. You can also unselect an object this
way.

<p>You can also select several objects at a time with a
selection box. You know how to draw a selection box, don't
you&nbsp;? Well, it works the same in Yadex. If press
[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] while setting the first corner of the box, all
objects in the box will be "toggle-selected" (that is, selected
if they weren't, unselected if they were).

<p>A more advanced way to select objects is path-selection. With
path selection, you can easily select all the linedefs that
form an object with a single keystroke. There are two variants
of path selection.

<p>To use the first, you must first highlight a linedef. Then
press [<kbd>e</kbd>]. All the linedefs that belong to the same
non-forked path as the highlighted linedef are selected. For
example&nbsp;:
<br>
<br>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td><img src="e1.png" alt="Before pressing [e]" WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=127>
<td><img src="e2.png" alt="After pressing [e]" WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=127>
<tr>
<td align="right"><i>Before pressing</i> [<kbd>e</kbd>]
<td align="right"><i>After pressing</i> [<kbd>e</kbd>]
</table>
<br>
<br>
Note how the selection stop at the first fork in the path.
That kind a path selection is good to select a path of single-
or double-sided linedefs that belong to the same sector.

<p>The other variant of path selection is better to select all
the linedefs that form a single pillar, even if not all of its
sides face the same sector. To use it, highlight a single-sided
linedef and press [<kbd>E</kbd>]. All the single-sided linedefs
that belong to the same path as the original one are
highlighted. For example&nbsp;:
<br>
<br>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td><img src="E1.png" alt="Before pressing [E]" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=160>
<td><img src="E2.png" alt="After pressing [E]" WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=160>
<tr>
<td align="right"><i>Before pressing</i> [<kbd>E</kbd>]
<td align="right"><i>After pressing</i> [<kbd>E</kbd>]
</table>
<br>
<br>
Note that the selection is not stopped by the forks in the path.
Also note that the double-sided linedefs are not selected.

<p>Like clicking, [<kbd>e</kbd>] and [<kbd>E</kbd>] have the
effect of unselecting everything else that was previously
selected unless you use [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]. If [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]
was pressed at the time you pressed [<kbd>e</kbd>] or
[<kbd>E</kbd>], all the linedefs that would have been selected
if you didn't press [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] are either removed from
the selection (if they were previously selected) or added to the
selection (if they weren't). This is actually simpler than it
sounds.

		<h3>The use of [<kbd>Shift</kbd>]</h3>

<p>The [<kbd>Shift</kbd>] key has an interesting property ; as
long as you hold it down, the highlight is locked. If an object
is not highlighted, it stays so even if you bring the mouse
pointer over it. Likewise, if an object is already highlighted,
it remains so, even if you move the pointer away from it.

<p> This can be useful in certain occasions, such as when you
want to compare two sectors that have other sectors between
them.

		<h3>Sector miscellaneous operations</h3>

<p><dt>Raise or lower sectors...
<dd>Prompts you for a number (N) and adds that number to the
floor and ceiling heights of all selected sectors. If N is
positive, this results in raising the sectors by N units. If N
is negative, this results in lowering the sectors by -N units.

<p><dt>Brighten or darken sectors...
<dd>Prompts you for a number (N) and adds that number to the
light level of all selected sectors. If N is positive, this
results in sectors becoming brighter. If N is positive, this
results in sectors becoming darker. No light level is decreased
below 0 or increased above 255.

<p><dt>Unlink room
<dd>This function is not implemented yet.

<p><dt>Mirror horizontally
<dd>This function starts by determining the set <var>S</var> of
vertices that are used by the selected sectors. Then all the
vertices in <var>S</var> have their x-coordinate changed so that
they're "mirrored" around the vertical axis that intersects the
geometric centre of <var>S</var>. Finally, all the linedefs
whose both vertices belong to <var>S</var> are flipped so that
the sector references remain correct.

<p>This function is designed to be used on either the whole
level or a group of isolated sectors (like in the screenshots
below). It is not recommended to use it on a group of sectors if
that group is connected to other sectors. You can do it but the
resulting mess might take you some time to untangle, especially
if there are many connecting linedefs.

<p>A common use for this function is when you have a symmetrical
room with, say, the same staircase on both sides of the axis of
symmetry. You can build one staircase, make a copy of it, mirror
the copy and paste it on the other side of the room.

<p>The new linedef goes from the first selected linedef to the
second selected linedef. The new sector is on the second

<p>There is a bug in this function ; if the sector contains
other sectors, some sidedefs are given the wrong sector number.
Jim Flynn has recently fixed this in DETH. Anyone to look into

<p><dt>Flip linedefs
<dd>The start and end vertices of the selected linedefs
are swapped. Their sidedefs are also swapped, so that the sector
references remain correct.

<p>If you want to flip linedefs without swapping their sidedefs,
you have to use "Flip linedefs" then "Swap sidedefs" on them.

<p><dt>Swap sidedefs
<dd>Swap the sidedefs of the selected linedefs <em>without</em>
flipping the linedefs. This means that the sector references are
also swapped. If you don't understand what this implies, don't
use this function.

<p><dt>Align textures (Y offset)

sidedef to -1.

<p><dt>Make rectangular nook (32x16)
<dd>This is a single-key function to make a rectangular
nook in the middle of a linedef. "Nook" means that, seen
from the first side of the original linedef, the resulting

one third of the length of the linedef.

of the selected linedefs so that they have the length
you specified.

<dd>Same thing as "Set length (move 1st vertex) but
moves the 2nd vertex.

<p><dt><a name="unlink_sidedefs">Unlink 1st sidedef</a>
<dd>This function is used when you have several linedefs
sharing common sidedefs and you don't want them to share
any sidedefs anymore so that you can, for instance, change
the sector reference or texture of one of the linedefs
independently from the others.

<p>Here is how it works&nbsp;: all sidedefs that are used on the
first side of any linedef in the selection and on any side of
any linedef <em>not</em> in the selection are duplicated and the
first side of the concerned linedefs in the selection is set to
use the copy instead of the original.

<p>Gotcha&nbsp;: note that the selected linedefs are not
"unlinked" from each other. They are only "unlinked" from any
other (i.e. non-selected) linedefs.  Thus, if you have
<em>n</em> linedefs that you want to unlink from each other, you
have to unlink every one of them separately. This is so that, if
you have, say, two square pillars (2 x 4 linedefs that all use
the same sidedef), you can easily unlink one pillar from the
other while still having its 4 linedefs all use the same
sidedef.

<p><dt>Unlink 2nd sidedef

instead of first sidedef.

<br>Press [<kbd>c</kbd>] to open the "clear linedef flags" popup menu.

		<h3>Undoing</h3>

<p>As of this release, undoing is not implemented.

		<h3>Cut-and-paste from one level to another</h3>

<p>As of this release, it's not possible.

		<h3>Using the flat/sprite/texture viewer</h3>

<p>Flats, sprites and textures are browsed and selected with the
same basic tool, snappily named the flat/sprite/texture viewer.
How do you use that beast&nbsp;?

<p><img src="vflat.png" alt="Browsing flats" WIDTH=315 HEIGHT=86>

<p><img src="vsprite.png" alt="Browsing sprites" WIDTH=379 HEIGHT=149>

<p><img src="vtexture.png" alt="Browsing textures" WIDTH=507 HEIGHT=149>

<p>You can change the current name simply by typing it. Use
[<kbd>Backspace</kbd>] to erase the rightmost character. As you
type, the list of names scrolls automatically so that the first
line of the list shows the first valid name that begins with the
characters in the entry box. If the current name does not belong
to the list, it is grayed out and you can't validate. If it
does, the corresponding image is shown in the box to the right.

<p>As in certain Unix programs, [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] is used for
name completion. If the current name is "<code>SW1</code>" and
you press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>], the current name is set to the first
name that begins with "<code>SW1</code>".

<p>[<kbd>Ctrl-u</kbd>] and [<kbd>Ctrl-w</kbd>] clear the current
name, like pressing [<kbd>Backspace</kbd>] repeatedly would.

<p>You can also move through the list without typing
names&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li>[<kbd>Up</kbd>] and [<kbd>Down</kbd>] move to the previous
or next name in the list.

<li>[<kbd>Pgup</kbd>] and [<kbd>Pgdn</kbd>] move one page at a time.

<li>[<kbd>Home</kbd>] and [<kbd>End</kbd>] move you to the first
or last name of the list.

<li>[<kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd>] does the same thing as [<kbd>Pgup</kbd>].

<li>[<kbd>Ctrl-f</kbd>] and [<kbd>Ctrl-v</kbd>] do the same
thing as [<kbd>Pgdn</kbd>].

</ul>


<p>To validate the current name as your choice, press
[<kbd>Return</kbd>]. If the current name is grayed-out
(invalid), [<kbd>Return</kbd>] does not work. To cancel, press
[<kbd>Esc</kbd>].

<p>In the DOS version, pressing [<kbd>Shift-F1</kbd>] used to
save the current flat/sprite/texture to a GIF file. However, in
the X11 version, this function is currently a no-op because I've
not taken the time to port the Gifsave library to Unix yet.
Besides, I'd rather use PPM and/or PNG than GIF.

<p>Finally when viewing sprites, two other useful commands are
[<kbd>Ctrl-n</kbd>] and [<kbd>Ctrl-p</kbd>]. These go
respectively to the next and previous group of sprites (all
sprites that have the same first 4 letters belong to the same
group). It's handy to skip the 69 animation frames of the heavy
weapon dude at once.

		<h3>Saving</h3>

<p>There are two ways to save&nbsp;:

<br><br><ul>
<li>Press [<kbd>F2</kbd>] or do "File-&gt;Save". If the level
comes from the iwad or if its level name or file name is unknown
(because it's a new level), you are prompted for a level name
(EnMn or MAPnm) and a file name first. If the file name has
changed since the last time you saved, and if a file of that
name already exists, you are asked confirmation before saving.

<p>The level in the window is saved in the specified file, in
the pwad format, under the specified .

<br><br><li>Press [<kbd>F3</kbd>] or do "File-&gt;Save as". This
procedure is identical to the "Save" procedure except that the
query for a level name and file name is unconditional.

</ul>

<p>FIXME -- this needs to be written...

<p>If Yadex is in Hexen mode, saving is disabled because writing
levels in the Hexen format is not supported as of this release.



		<h3>Closing a window</h3>

<p>There are two ways to close a window&nbsp;:

<br><br><ul>
<li>Press [<kbd>Esc</kbd>]. If you have made changes since the
last time you saved, or if you have never saved, Yadex requires
confirmation before closing the window.

<br><br><li>Press [<kbd>q</kbd>] or do "File-&gt;Quit". If
you have made changes since the last time you saved, or if you
have never saved, Yadex first saves the level, using the same
procedure as when you press [<kbd>F2</kbd>]. After that the
window is closed. If the saving procedure is interactive (for
example because it's the first time you save), and if you cancel
it, the window is not closed.

</ul>

the configuration file, the environment variables,
the command line options and the Preferences menu.

<p> The choices made in the Preferences menu override all others
but they are lost when you exit Yadex.

<p> The command line options override the environment variables
which in turn override the configuration file.

<p> The details of command line options and environment
variables are explained elsewhere.

		<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>When you create objects, their properties are automatically
given default values. Some of those default values can be set
from the configuration file or from the command line but also
through the Preferences menu, that pops up when you press
[<kbd>F5</kbd>].

<p> The settings entered through the Preferences menu are lost
when you exit Yadex.

		<h3>Configuration file</h3>

<p>If you don't specify "<code>-f</code>" on the command line,
Yadex tries to open the following files in order&nbsp;:
<p>
<ol>
<li><code>./yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>~/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code><var>install_dir</var>/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>/etc/yadex.cfg</code>
</ol>
<p>
The first file found is used.

<p>If you use "<code>-f&nbsp;<var>file</var></code>" and
"<code><var>file</var></code>" is an absolute name (i.e. it starts
with "<code>/</code>"), only that name is used.

<p>If "<code><var>file</var></code>" is a relative name, the
standard directories will be searched for a file of that name
instead of "<code>yadex.cfg</code>". For example, if you
specify "<code>-f&nbsp;foo/bar</code>", Yadex will try to open
"<code>./foo/bar</code>", "<code>~/foo/bar</code>", and so on.

<p>For Yadex to recognize the file as a configuration file, its
first line must contain exactly the following characters&nbsp;:
"<code>#&nbsp;Yadex&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;file&nbsp;version&nbsp;2</code>"
(without the double quotes). If it doesn't, Yadex will print an
error message and bail out. The reason for being so fussy is to
avoid headaches when the configuration file format changes and
there are old configuration files lying around in your
directories.

<p>The configuration file is self-documenting. Look at the
sample configuration file in the Yadex distribution to see what
options are available.

		<h3>Game definition files</h3>

<p>A lot of Yadex's knowledge about thing numbers and names,
linedef types etc. is stored in so-called game definition files.
When you specify "<code>-g foo</code>", it in fact means that
Yadex should use the game definition file named
"<code>foo.ygd</code>".

<p>When looking for the game definition file, Yadex tries those
names in order&nbsp;:
<ol>
<li><code>./<var>game</var>.ygd</code>
<li><code>~/<var>game</var>.ygd</code>
<li><code><var>install_dir</var>/<var>game</var>.ygd</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/<var>game</var>.ygd</code>
<li><code>/usr/share/games/<var>game</var>.ygd</code>
</ol>

<p>For Yadex to recognize the file as a game definition file,
they must begin with a certain magic string. If they don't,
Yadex will print an error message an bail out. The reason for
being so fussy is to avoid headaches when the game definition
file format changes and there are old game definition files
lying around in your directories.

<p>Game definition files are not supposed to be modified in
normal use. Their format is described <a
href="ygd.html">there</a>.


		<h3>The font</h3>

<p>By default, Yadex uses the default font of your system (that
is often "<code>fixed</code>" a.k.a. "<code>6x13</code>"). But
you can use the font of your choice by using the "<code>-fn
</code><var>font_name</var>" option or setting
"<code>font&nbsp;=&nbsp;</code><var>font_name</var>" in
<code>yadex.cfg</code>. You should use a fixed-width font and
not one that is too large for the size of your Yadex window or
the display will look ugly.

<p> You can get a list of all available fonts on your system
with the command <code>xlsfonts</code>.

		<h3>Mouse wheel and other mouse issues</h3>

			<h4>Button 3</h4>

<p>The mouse 3rd button is not used yet but you can bet it will
a future version. So a 3-button mouse is of course recommended.

			<h4>Buttons 4 and 5</h4>

<p>People who have a mouse with more than 3 buttons, rejoyce !
Buttons 4 and 5 are used (for zooming in and out). See the
paragraph on mice wheels below.

			<h4>Swapping buttons</h4>

<p>You can swap the left and right buttons by setting the <a
href="#param_swap_buttons"><code>swap_buttons</code></a>
variable.

			<h4>Wheel</h4>

<p>The wheel that certain recent mice have is supported. But to
be able to use it, you need to first make X aware that your
mouse has a wheel. There are several ways to do that and they
might vary depending on which X server you have. I have XFree86
and a Logitech Pilot Mouse + and this is what I put in my
<code>XF86Config</code> file :

<p>
<pre>Section "Pointer"
    Protocol      "Intellimouse"                                      
    Device        "/dev/mouse"                                      
    Buttons       5                                                 
    ZAxisMapping  4 5</pre>

<p>This means that the wheel is mapped to buttons 4 and 5. When
you roll the wheel "up" (forwards), button4 press events are
generated. When you roll the wheel "down" (backwards), button5
press events are generated.

<p> Once you have done that, not only you can use the wheel in
Yadex to zoom in and out but can also use it in all other X
applications. That is, those that have bindings for buttons 4
and 5. One such application is <code>xterm</code> : the wheel
scrolls the window up and down through the scrolling region.

	<h2><a name="bugs">
	Annex A: known bugs</a></h2>

<p>Though Yadex has quite a few bugs, most of them are
inconsequential, i.e. not likely to make Yadex unusable or
damage precious data. On the other hand, <strong>some can
bite</strong>. Those are the ones you should know about&nbsp;:

<ul>
<li>Command line options that take an argument
need to have a space between their argument and themselves.

<li>Exposure events are not always handled.
If the Yadex window turns black,
back out by pressing [<kbd>Esc</kbd>],
several times if necessary.

<li>If you edit a level from a file that contains several and save it,
all the other levels from that file are lost.
</ul>

Check <a href="TODO"><code>TODO</code></a> for a complete list
of things to fix.

	<h2><a name="games">
	Annex B: Which games are supported ?</a></h2>

		<h3>Doom</h3>

<p>Supported. Linedef types and sector types added in v. 1.666
are supported and marked with "<code>[v1.6]</code>".

		<h3>Doom II</h3>

<p>Supported.

		<h3>Doom alpha</h3>

<p>Mostly supported. There are three Doom alpha versions that I
know of&nbsp;: <a
href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/historic/doom0_2.zip">0.2</a>,
<a
href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/historic/doom0_4.zip">0.4</a>
and <a
href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/historic/doom0_5.zip">0.5</a>.
They're supported to a varying degree of completeness. All
graphics resources (flats, patches, <code>PLAYPAL</code>,
sprites and textures) are supported for all versions with the
exception of version 0.2, for which textures are not supported.

<p>Reading levels does not work either for version 0.2. For
version 0.4 and 0.5, it works, including levels
<code>E1M10</code> through <code>E1M13</code>. There are some
oddities in the levels, such as linedefs with negative types or
things with strange bits set in their flags, but I don't think
it's Yadex's fault.

<p>You can edit and save alpha levels be they will be saved in
the regular Doom format, not the alpha format. Writing levels in
the Doom alpha format is not supported at all and probably never
will, for three reasons. Firstly, there are parts of the format
that I don't understand, and therefore don't know how to
generate. Secondly, there is AFAIK no nodes builder for the
alphas. Thirdly, even if the two above problems were solved, I
don't expect many people to actually want to use the alphas
because, from a player point of view, they're much less
comfortable than the later versions of Doom. To say nothing of
the fact that all we have is a DOS executable and no source
code.  That being said, I can't deny that it would indeed be
cool to be able to generate wads for the alphas, if only for the
fun of it.  If you want to do it, I won't discourage you and I
will gladly accept patches.

		<h3>Doom press release pre-beta</h3>

<p>Supported. The different picture format is handled. Things
type 2016 (evil sceptre) and 2017 (unholy bible) are defined in
<code>doom02.ygd</code>, <code>doom04.ygd</code>,
<code>doom05.ygd</code>, <code>doompr.ygd</code>,
<code>doom.ygd</code> and <code>doom2.ygd</code> and marked with
"<code>[PR]</code>".  However, if you're using
<code>betalevl.wad</code> and <code>betagrph.wad</code> supplied
with MBF, you won't see the corresponding sprites because Yadex
does not support sprites in pwads (yet). To see the sprites for
the evil sceptre and the unholy bible as well as the alternate
versions of the other sprites, you need to use the iwad from <a
href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/historic/doomprbt.zip"
><code>doomprbt.zip</code></a>.

		<h3>Final Doom</h3>

<p>Supported, AFAIK. The iwads have no
<code>F1_START/F1_END</code> labels and some levels contain a
thing of type 0 which made older versions of Yadex crash. This
has been fixed in version 1.1.0.

		<h3>Heretic</h3>

<p>Supported. Still missing: the sprite names for a couple of
thing types. If there is a Heretic hacker out there willing to
help, he/she is welcome. See "<code>heretic.ygd</code>".

		<h3>Hexen</h3>

<p>Very rudimentary support. You can load Hexen wads and edit
the maps. But the things types are not all there. And the
special features of Hexen (<code>BEHAVIOR</code> lump, new thing
and linedef fields) are stripped off on reading. So don't try to
save a Hexen level after editing it, you won't be able to use it
with Hexen. And if you're saving it to the file it comes from,
you'll lose your file. <strong>Don't save when in Hexen
mode.</strong>

		<h3>Strife</h3>

<p>Supported, except that&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li>many thing types are missing,
<li>some thing flags are not known,
<li>many linedef types are missing or wrong,
<li>some linedef flags might be missing,
<li>some sector types might be missing.
</ul>
And perhaps other things as well. If you're a Strife hacker,
your help would be welcome.

<p>If you have Strife 1.0, you should use
<code>-g&nbsp;strife10</code>. Strife&nbsp;1.0 uses the same
format as Doom for textures, Strife&nbsp;1.1 and later use a
different format.

		<h3>Ultimate Doom</h3>

<p>Supported.

		<h3>Boom</h3>

<p>Kind of supported, only very inconvenient to use &lt;g&gt;.
<dl>
<dt>New linedef flag "P" (pass through)
<dd>Supported.

<dt>New linedef types
<dd>You can enter arbitrary linedef types ("enter number").

<dt>New sector types
<dd>You can enter arbitrary sector types ("enter number")

<dt>New things flags "N" (not in deathmatch) and "C" (not in coop)
<dd>Supported.

<dt>New things types 5001 and 5002
<dd>Supported.

<dt>Special lumps <code>SWITCHES</code> and <code>ANIMATED</code>
<dd>Unsupported.
</dl>
In progress...

		<h3>MBF</h3>

Mostly supported, I think. Thing 888 (dog), thing flag 80h
(friendly), linedef types 271 and 272 are all in. You can't see
the sprite for the dog because it's embedded in the MBF
executable.

		<h3>Other derivatives</h3>

<p>Not supported so far.

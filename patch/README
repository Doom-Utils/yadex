Patches for Yadex
-----------------

gcc-2.7.diff	To compile Yadex 1.5.0 with GCC 2.7. To apply,
		
		  cd yadex-1.5.0
		  patch -p1 <patch/gcc-2.7.diff

		GCC 2.7 is not recommended to compile C++. It's
		shipped with a very old version of STL, hence
		conflict on "times" and missing clear(). It
		insists on having default constructors for
		classes used in conjunction with the STL
		containers. It wants three arguments for map<>.
		It barfs if you use -> on the right hand of an
		iterator. It's a pain.

		I consider GCC 2.7 obsolete, and not a supported
		compiler for Yadex. This patch will rot or go
		away. Please upgrade. More recent versions of
		EGCS and GCC work fine.

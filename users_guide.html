	<h2>1. Yadex in a nutshell</h2>

Yadex is Doom/Doom II/Heretic level (wad) editor for X.

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2>2. What do I need ?</h2>

To compile, install and run this release of Yadex, you need
<ul>
<li>a POSIX-compatible environment (such as Unix),
<li>an ISO C/C++ compiler (preferably GCC or EGCS),
<li>GNU make (it won't work with other flavours of make),
<li>an HTML viewer to read the doc,
<li>a Doom/Doom II/Heretic iwad.
<li>X11R6.
</ul>
<p>
More specifically, Yadex expects that
<ul>
<li>the routines in <code>ctype.h</code> accept the range
	<code>CHAR_MIN</code> through <code>UCHAR_MAX</code>,
<li>the <code>nanosleep()</code> system call is supported.
</ul>

		<h3>Iwad</h3>

A shareware Doom or Heretic iwad is okay
but you need a registered iwad if you want to
be able to save your changes.

		<h3>Directories</h3>

Yadex conforms to the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">
FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)</a>.
The installation procedure will try to copy files in the following
directories, creating the directories if they don't exist ;
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/etc</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/</code>
</ul>
So make sure you have the necessary rights before installing
(or change the makefile).
<p>

		<h3>Display</h3>

Yadex uses about 270 different colours.
In most cases, on PseudoColor displays,
there aren't that many free colour cells.
So, if it detects a PseudoColor display,
Yadex uses a private colormap so as to
get as many free colour cells as possible.
The inconvenient of this method is that,
when you're in the Yadex window, all other
windows are displayed with wrong colours
and vice-versa.
<p>
What's more, as PseudoColor displays typically
have 256 colours (at least on PC), which is
less than the number of colours needed, Yadex
might have to assign the same physical colour
to different logical colours. If it happens,
it will try to render the colours of the game
accurately at the expense of the application
colours.
<p>
Monochrome displays might work but they have
not been tested.
<p>
Executive summary: if you can, use a TrueColor
or DirectColor display and a depth of more
than 8 bits per pixel (E.G. by launching X
with "<code>startx -- -bpp 16</code>").
<p>
A 640x480 screen is okay though, of course, a larger display
is better.

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2><a name="compiling">
	3. Compiling and installing Yadex</a></h2>

See <a href="README"><code>README</code></a>.
<p>
Don't forget to tell Yadex where your iwads are
by changing the lines "<code>iwad1&nbsp;=</code>",
"<code>iwad2&nbsp;=</code>" and "<code>iwad3&nbsp;=</code>"
in <code>/usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg</code>.
If there is an iwad you don't have, you can just
comment out the corresponding line.

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2>4. I've never used Yadex. Where do I start ?</h2>

		<h3>I know nothing about Doom editing</h3>

This section is meant to be a quick introduction to using Yadex.
I assume you already know the basics of Doom editing,
i.e. what vertices, linedefs, sidedefs, things and sectors are
and how they work together.
If you don't, it would be good idea to
go get a Doom editing tutorial.
If at first it seems confusing, persevere.
It worked for me anyway ;-).

		<h3><a name="q_running">
		How do I run Yadex ?</a></h3>

You must have successfully compiled, installed and configured Yadex.
If you haven't, see <a href="#compiling">there</a>.
<p>
For the sake of discussion, we'll assume you want to edit MAP01
of Doom II. From the shell, type&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>$ yadex -g doom2</code>
<p>
(of course, you don't have to type the "<code>$</code>" !)<br>
You should see a couple of messages
and then the Yadex prompt, which looks like this&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>[? for help]</code>
<p>
At this prompt, type&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>[? for help] e map01</code>
<p>
(once again, don't type the "<code>[? for help]</code>" !)<br>
The editor window opens.

		<h3>Moving around in the edit window</h3>

There you are.
What you should see now is a window
with the map of the level you wanted to edit.
<p>
On top of the window, there is the menu bar.
I assume you know what a menu bar is.
On bottom of the window, there is the info bar.
It displays some information about your current status&nbsp;:
the name of the level you're editing,
whether it has changed since last saved,
in which editing mode you are,
etc.
<p>
Try to move the pointer around.
Note that the info bar shows the position of the pointer
in map coordinates.
<p>
If you move near the edge of the window,
or press [<kbd>Left</kbd>], [<kbd>Right</kbd>],
[<kbd>Up</kbd>], [<kbd>Down</kbd>],
[<kbd>Home</kbd>], [<kbd>End</kbd>],
[<kbd>Page-up</kbd>] or [<kbd>Page-down</kbd>],
the map scrolls.
<p>
You can also zoom in and out by pressing [<kbd>+</kbd>] and [<kbd>-</kbd>].

		<h3>Highlighting, selecting, dragging, changing properties</h3>

As you are now in "things" mode (as you can see on the info bar),
every time you pass over a thing, it is highlighted
and a window pops up in the bottom left corner of the window
that shows the properties of that thing.
<p>
What if you want to change the properties of a thing ?
Double-click on it or highlight it and press [<kbd>Return</kbd>].
A menu pops up in the top left corner of the window.
Select the property you want to change
and yet another window pops up.
Enter the new value of the property and that's it.
<p>
You can drag things around ;
click on the thing and, without releasing the button,
move the pointer to where you want to move it to
and then release the button.
If you want to move a group of things,
select them all, and drag one of them.
All selected things follow.
<p>
To select several things,
you can either hold [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] down and click on each of them in turn
or select them all at once with a selection box.
To do that, click on an empty spot and,
without releasing the button, move the pointer
to where you want the other corner of the box to be.
Then release the button ;
all the things within the box are selected.
<p>
Note that when you start a selection box,
everything else is unselected.
If you don't want that to happen,
hold [<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] down while you draw the box.
Thus you can <em>add</em> the contents of the new box
to the selection.

		<h3>Deleting and creating</h3>

You can delete things by pressing [<kbd>Del</kbd>].
It will delete all selected things
or, if there is no selection, the highlighted thing.
<p>
You can also create a new thing under the pointer
by pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>].
If, at the moment you press [<kbd>Ins</kbd>],
there is a thing highlighted,
the new thing will be created with the same properties as its "model".
Else, it will have the default properties
as defined in the Preferences.

		<h3>Modes</h3>

So far we've only edited things.
Now how do we edit other objects ?
As I've said before, you're in "things" mode.
If you press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>], you will switch to the next mode,
that is the vertices mode.
Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and you are in linedefs-and-sidedefs mode.
Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and you are in sectors mode.
Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and you are back in things mode.
You can also use [<kbd>Shift-Tab</kbd>] to cycle backwards through the modes
and [<kbd>t</kbd>], [<kbd>v</kbd>], [<kbd>l</kbd>] and [<kbd>s</kbd>]
to go directly to a particular mode.
<p>
The other modes work like the things mode
except that you operate on different types of objects.

		<h3>Zooming and the grid</h3>

Use [<kbd>g</kbd>] and [<kbd>G</kbd>] to change the grid step.
<br>
Use [<kbd>y</kbd>] if you want to be able to place objects
"off" the grid.

		<h3>Creating complex objects</h3>

Click on the "Objects" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F9</kbd>] and look at the menu that pops up.
<br>
You can also create a sector from a path of linedefs
by selecting those linedefs and pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>].
<br>
You can create a linedef between two vertices
by selecting those vertices and pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>].

		<h3>Advanced functions</h3>

Click on the "Misc" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F8</kbd>] in different modes
and look at the menu that pops up.

		<h3>Checks</h3>

Click on the "Checks" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F10</kbd>] and look at the menu that pops up.

		<h3>Saving and exiting</h3>

If you still haven't, please make some modifications
to the level.
For example change some textures and light levels
and add, say, a dozen of cyberdemons in the courtyard.
<p>
I want you to save the modified level to a pwad
named <code>mywad.wad</code> so that you can test
it with Doom.
To do that, press [<kbd>F2</kbd>].
Don't worry, it will not overwrite your iwad.
Individual levels are always saved to a pwad.
You are prompted for a file name.
Enter <code>mywad.wad</code>.
<p>
Before when go on, here a few things worth mentioning&nbsp;:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
If you press [<kbd>Esc</kbd>], you quit without saving.
If you have unsaved changes, you are asked to confirm.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>q</kbd>], you save and quit.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>F2</kbd>], you save.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>F3</kbd>], like [<kbd>F2</kbd>] but
you can save under a different level name (E.G. MAP02).
</p>
<li>
Whenever you are queried for a file name,
remember that the <code>.wad</code> extension is <em>not</em>
automatically appended.
In addition, if you used to be a DOS/Windows user,
remember that Unix treats file names case-sensitively
so you'd better think twice before using names like FOO.WAD.
</p>
<li>
When a <code>.wad</code> file is changed,
a backup is made in the same directory and with the same name
but with the extension <code>.bak</code>.
</p>
<li>
I said above that iwads are not overwritten.
The same is not true of pwads.
If you edit a level that comes from a pwad,
it will be saved to the same pwad file,
unless you specify a different file name.
</p>
<li>
<strong>GOTCHA: when you save to a pwad,
everything that used to be in that pwad is lost !</strong>
For example, if you load a pwad that contains
MAP01 and MAP02, edit MAP01 and save MAP01 to
the same pwad file, the level MAP02 it used
to contain is <em>lost</em> !
It's unfortunate but not very easy to fix.
</ul>
<p>
Now press [<kbd>Esc</kbd>].
The editing window closes and
you are returned to the Yadex prompt.
From there, use the "<code>e</code>" or "<code>c</code>" commands
to edit another level
or use the "<code>q</code>" command to really quit Yadex.

		<h3>Testing your level</h3>

<strong>GOTCHA: Before you test your level,
you MUST run it through a nodes builder.</strong>
If you don't, you'll get strange results
or you'll crash Doom/Heretic.
<p>
There are several nodes builders around.
One of the best is BSP 2.3.
Lee Killough kindly allowed me to include
it with the Yadex distribution.
To build the nodes on your level with BSP
and then test it with Doom,
type something along the lines of&nbsp;:
<p>
<pre>$ bsp mywad.wad -o final.wad
$ doom -file final.wad
</pre>

		<h3>Fixing your level</h3>

You've tested your level and you've found
that some things need to be fixed.
What do you do ?
Well, go back to <a href="#q_running">
How do I run Yadex</a> except that, this time,
you need to tell Yadex to load your pwad.
You do that by running Yadex with the name
of your pwad as argument (you can ommit
the <code>.wad</code> extension). E.G.&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>$ yadex -g doom2 mywad</code>
<p>
That's it !
You've been through an entire edit-build-test-edit cycle.
Doubtlessly the first of thousands :-).

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2>5. Running Yadex</h2>

		<h3>The command line arguments</h3>

Yadex takes two sorts of command line arguments : parameters and options.
An option is a command line argument that starts with a "<code>-</code>".
<p>
Some options take an argument.
The argument must be separated from the option by some whitespace.
<strong>Constructs like "<code>-othingy</code>" are not recognized.
You have to type "<code>-o thingy</code>".</strong>
<p>
The "<code>-file</code>" option takes a variable number
of arguments. It uses all the non-options up to the next option.
<p>
The options that take no argument can be negated by using
a "<code>+</code>" instead of a "<code>-</code>".
For example, "<code>+sb</code>" will undo the effect
of a "<code>swap_buttons&nbsp;= true</code>" directive in the config file.
<p>
In general, if you specify the same option more than once,
the last occurrence overrides the previous ones.
For example, "<code>yadex +P -P</code>"
is equivalent to "<code>yadex -P</code>".
Similarly, "<code>yadex -i1 foo.wad -i1 bar.wad -i1 baz.wad</code>"
boils down to "<code>yadex -i1 baz.wad</code>".
<p>
The "<code>-pwad</code>" (or "<code>-pw</code>") option,
however are additive.
Each occurrence will add to the previous ones.
For instance, "<code>yadex -pwad foo.wad -pwad bar.wad</code>"
is equivalent to "<code>yadex foo.wad bar.wad</code>".
<p>
Any command line argument that is not an option
is treated as the name of a pwad to load.
You can put as many names of pwads on the command line
as you wish (or none at all).
The details of specifying pwad names are discussed <a href="#pwads">there</a>.

		<h3>Options</h3>

To know about the command line options that Yadex understands, type
<p>
<code>$ yadex -help</code>
<p>
You'll get this:
<p>
<pre>
-f  -config_file   <i>string</i>     Config file
-d  -debug                    Debug mode
-e  -expert                   Expert mode
-fc -fake_cursor              Fake cursor
-fn -font          <i>string</i>     Font name
-g  -game          <i>string</i>     Game
-h  -height        <i>integer</i>    Initial window height
-?  -help                     Show usage summary
-i1 -iwad1         <i>string</i>     The name of Doom IWAD
-i2 -iwad2         <i>string</i>     The name of the Doom II IWAD
-i3 -iwad3         <i>string</i>     The name of the Heretic IWAD
-pw -pwad          <i>string</i>     Patch WAD file
-P  -no_pixmap                No pixmap, saves memory, more flicker
-q  -quiet                    Quiet mode
-qq -quieter                  Quieter mode
-s0 -select0                  Automatic selection of 0th object
-sb -swap_buttons             Swap mouse buttons
-td -text_dot                 DrawScreenText debug flag
-v  -verbose                  Verbose mode
-w  -width         <i>integer</i>    Initial window width
-z  -zoom          <i>integer</i>    Initial zoom factor
</pre>
You might wonder what the "<code>-file</code>",
"<code>-pw</code>" and "<code>-pwad</code>" options are for
since it's so simple to just put the names of the pwads
on the command line. The answer is that they're only here
for compatibility with previous versions of Yadex/Yade/DEU.
Don't use them. They might go away one day.

		<h3><a name="game">
		Specifying the game for which you want to edit</a></h3>

Yadex can handle several games (Doom, Doom II and Heretic)
but only one at a time.
Unfortunately, that game can't be changed dynamically.
If you want to switch game, you must quit Yadex and run it again.
<p>
By default, the game used is the one specified by the
"<code>game=</code>" directive in the configuration file.
If you want to override the default, use "<code>-g <i>game</i></code>".

		<h3><a name="pwads">
		Specifying the names of pwads to load</a></h3>

When you have to specify the name of a pwad to load,
for example in the <code>r</code> command,
or as a command line argument,
you don't always have to spell it all out.
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The <code>.wad</code> extension can be omitted,
it will be added automatically.
For example, specifying the name "<code>foo</code>"
is equivalent to specifying "<code>foo.wad</code>".
An unfortunate consequence of this convention is
that it's impossible to load a wad that would be
really called "<code>foo</code>".
Though, under DOS, you can still work around this limitation
by specifying the name with a trailing dot,
("<code>foo.</code>").
<p>
<li>
The path can sometimes be omitted too, if the
wad is in one of the <dfn>standard directories</dfn>,
or one of their subdirectories.
If no file of the name you specified
is found in the current directory,
Yadex will look for a file of that name
in the standard directories, which are&nbsp;:
<ol>
<li>your home directory,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/</code><i>game</i>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/</code><i>game</i>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/wads</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/wads</code>,
</ol>
(where <i>game</i> is the name of the <a href="#game">game</a>).
<p>
On the other hand, if you give an absolute file name,
that is one that begins with a "<code>/</code>",
the standard directories will <em>not</em> be used.
Yadex will only try to open the file
of the exact name you specified.
<p>
For example, if you type "<code>yadex -g doom2 foo/bar</code>",
Yadex will look for the following files in order&nbsp;:
<ol>
<li><code>~/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/doom2/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/doom2/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/wads/foo/bar.wad</code>,
<li><code>/usr/share/games/wads/foo/bar.wad</code>,
</ol>
and open the first it finds.
<p>
But if you type "<kbd>yadex -g doom2 /foo/bar</kbd>"
(note the leading slash),
Yadex will try to open "<code>/foo/bar.wad</code>", period.
<p>
The philosophy behind those standard directories is that&nbsp;:
<ul>
<li>a local file overrides a global one,
<li>a game-specific file overrides a non-game-specific one.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Gotcha:
those shorthands can only be used when <em>reading</em> a pwad.
When <em>writing</em> to a pwad,
you always have to specify the exact name,
with the full path and extension.

		<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<dl>
<dt><code>DISPLAY</code>
<dd>Unix only. The name of the X display that Yadex will try to connect to.

<dt><code>YADEX_GAME</code>
<dd>Indicates the game to use.
Overrides the <code>game</code> parameter in the config file,
is overridden by the <code>-g</code> command line option.
</dl>

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2>6. Editing levels with Yadex</h2>

		<h3>Using external textures and flats</h3>

Like Doom, Yadex accepts the addition and replacement
of textures and flats from pwads.
You just need to load those pwads into Yadex.
<p>
Flats should be placed between <code>FF_START</code> and <code>F_END</code>.
The pwads produced by Deutex are fine
except that they have an <code>FF_END</code> marker after the flats.
You can make them usable by Yadex and Doom
by replacing <code>FF_END</code> by <code>F_END</code>
with a binary editor.
You don't need Deusf.
<p>
Replacing other resources may or may not work.
<code>PLAYPAL</code> very probably does,
sprites probably don't.

		<h3>Logging of time spent</h3>

If you edit a level from a file and
there exists a file in the same directory
with the same name but with the extension <code>.yl</code>,
that file will be used to keep track
of the time you spent editing that level.
At the end of the editing session,
Yadex will append a line to the <code>.yl</code> file
with the name of the level and the number of minutes spent on it.
<p>
Note that if the <code>.yl</code> file does not already exist,
it is <em>not</em> created.
This is to prevent the creation of a large number of small
useless files when browsing through a collection of wads.
Thus, if you want to enable logging,
you need to manually create the log file first
with a command such as "<code>touch <i>name</i>.yl</code>".

		<h3>The prompt commands</h3>

You can get a summary of the prompt commands
by typing "<code>?</code>" at the Yadex prompt.

		<h3>Moving around</h3>

			<h4>Moving the pointer</h4>

In the X11 version, the only way to do that is to
move the pointer device (i.e. the mouse).

			<h4>Scrolling</h4>

The arrow keys [<kbd>Left</kbd>], [<kbd>Right</kbd>],
[<kbd>Up</kbd>] and [<kbd>Down</kbd>] scroll a little
at a time, by default 10% of the screen/window width
or height. You can change the exact amount by setting
the variable <code>scroll_less</code> in the
configuration file.
<p>
[<kbd>Page-up</kbd>], [<kbd>Page-down</kbd>],
[<kbd>Home</kbd>] and [<kbd>End</kbd>] scroll more
at a time, by default 90% of the screen/window width
or height. You can change the exact amount by setting
the variable <code>scroll_more</code> in the
configuration file.

			<h4>Autoscrolling</h4>

When the pointer rests close to the edge of the
screen/window, the map scrolls automatically.
The closer you are to the edge, the faster it
scrolls.
<p>
You can fine tune autoscrolling by changing the
variables <code>autoscroll_amp</code> and
<code>autoscroll_edge</code>.
<p>
Autoscrolling is disabled near the menu bar items
so that the map does not scroll when you're reaching
for the menu.
<p>
You can disable autoscrolling completely by setting
<code>autoscroll</code> to <code>false</code> in
the configuration file.

			<h4>Jumping</h4>

I plan to develop a full set-mark/jump-to-mark
system similar to the one in <code>vi</code>,
with <code>m<i>mark-name</i></code>, <code>'<i>mark-name</i></code>
and <code>`<i>mark-name</i></code>.
<p>
For the moment, if you press [<kbd>'</kbd>],
the map scrolls so that its centre is at the
centre of the screen/window.
<p>
If you press [<kbd>`</kbd>], the map scrolls so
that its centre is at the centre of the screen/window
and the zoom factor is adjusted so that the whole
map is visible and almost fills the screen/window.

		<h3>Zooming in and out</h3>

The current zoom factor is shown on the info bar,
after the word "<code>Scale:</code>".
It is shown in pixels per map units.
The indication "<code>Scale: 1/2</code>"
means that one pixel of the display
corresponds to 2 map units.
<p>
You can zoom in by pressing [<kbd>+</kbd>] or [<kbd>=</kbd>]
or the 4th mouse button or by moving the mouse wheel "up".
<p>
You can zoom out by pressing [<kbd>-</kbd>] or [<kbd>_</kbd>]
or the 5th mouse button or by moving the mouse wheel "down".
<p>
You can also set the zoom factor directly
with the keys [<kbd>0</kbd>] through [<kbd>9</kbd>].

		<h3>The grid</h3>

The <dfn>grid</dfn> is a square mesh of blue lines in the background.
It's here to help you aligning your objects
correctly with regard to Doom's metrics,
which will save you a lot of textures misalignments.
<p>
When you insert or drag objects, they are <dfn><i>snapped to grid</i></dfn>.
That is Yadex prevents you from placing them off the grid.
You can toggle the <code>snap_to_grid</code> flag by pressing [<kbd>y</kbd>].
<p>
The grid step is always a power of 2, E.G. 128, 64, 32, etc.
You can get a finer grid (dividing the grid step by 2)
by pressing [<kbd>g</kbd>].
Conversely, pressing [<kbd>G</kbd>] multiplies the grid step by 2.
If you press [<kbd>g</kbd>] when the grid step is already at
its minimum value, it will be set to its maximum value.
And conversely.
The minimum and maximum values are set in the configuration
file with <code>grid_min</code> and <code>grid_max</code>.
<p>
When you change the zoom factor, Yadex automatically
changes the grid step to make it what it thinks is
best for the new zoom factor.
If you want to lock the grid step to its current value,
press [<kbd>z</kbd>].
To unlock it, press that key again.
<p>
You can hide the grid by pressing [<kbd>h</kbd>]
(but this doesn't disable <code>snap_to_grid</code>).
Press that key again to make the grid visible again.
<p>
You can also use [<kbd>H</kbd>] to reset the grid step.

		<h3>Inserting objects</h3>

By pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>], you insert a new object under the pointer.
<p>
If an object of the same type is highlighted at the moment
you press [<kbd>Ins</kbd>], the properties of the new object are copied
from the highlighted object.
In other words, the highlighted object serves as a "model".
Else the properties of the new object are set to default
values.
<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>

		<h3>Copying objects</h3>

		<h3>Deleting objects</h3>

		<h3>Changing the properties of objects</h3>

		<h3>Moving objects a.k.a. drag-and-drop</h3>

		<h3>Selecting objects</h3>

		<h3>The use of [<kbd>Shift</kbd>]</h3>

The [<kbd>Shift</kbd>] key has an interesting property ;
as long as you hold it down, the highlight is locked.
If an object is not highlighted,
it stays so even if you bring the mouse pointer over it.
Likewise, if an object is already highlighted,
it remains so, even if you move the pointer away from it.
<p>
This can be useful in certain occasions,
such as when you want to compare two sectors
that have other sectors between them.

		<h3>Sector miscellaneous operations</h3>

		<h3>Thing miscellaneous operations</h3>

		<h3>Setting/toggling/clearing thing flags</h3>

In things mode, press [<kbd>a</kbd>] to open the "set thing flags" popup menu.
<br>Press [<kbd>b</kbd>] to open the "toggle thing flags" popup menu.
<br>Press [<kbd>c</kbd>] to open the "clear thing flags" popup menu.

		<h3>Vertex miscellaneous operations</h3>

		<h3>Linedef miscellaneous operations</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Find first free tag number
<dd>Displays the smallest tag number greater than 0
and not used by any linedef or sector.

<p><dt>Rotate and scale LD & SD...
<dd>TBD.

<p><dt>Split linedef (add new vertex)
<dd>Split all selected linedefs, by adding a vertex
in the middle.
<p>
The key [<kbd>x</kbd>] is a shortcut to this function.

<p><dt>Split linedefs and sector
<dd>Split both selected linedefs in the middle by adding a vertex
for each, create a linedef between the two new vertices and
split the sector with this new linedef.
There must be exactly 2 selected linedefs and they
must face a common sector.
<p>
The new linedef goes from the first selected linedef to the
second selected linedef.
The new sector is on the second sidedef of the new linedef.
<p>
There is a bug in this function ; if the sector
contains other sectors, some sidedefs are given
the wrong sector number. Jim Flynn has recently
fixed this in DETH.
<p>
The key [<kbd>w</kbd>] is a shortcut to this function.

<p><dt>Delete linedefs and join sector
<dd>Dude.

<p><dt>Flip linedef
<dd>The start and end vertices of the selected linedef
are swapped and so are its first and second sidedefs.

<p><dt>Swap sidedefs
<dd>Swap the first and second sidedefs of the selected
linedefs <em>without</em> swapping the start and end
vertices. This means that the sector references are also
swapped. If you don't understand what this implies,
don't use this function.

<p><dt>Align textures (Y offset)
<dd>This function is buggy.

<p><dt>Align textures (X offset)
<dd>This function is buggy.

<p><dt>Remove 2nd sidedef (make single-sided)
<dd>When two superimposed linedefs are merged, the
result is often a two-sided linedefs, even though
the second sidedef faces no sector.
Use this function to fix the mess.
<p>
It sets the I flag, clears the 2 flag and
sets the second sidedef to -1.

<p><dt>Make rectangular nook (32x16)
<dd>This is a single-key function to make a rectangular
nook in the middle of a linedef. "Nook" means that, seen
from the first side of the original linedef, the resulting
5 linedefs form a concave figure.
<p>
If the linedef is not long enough, the length of the nook
is one third of the length of the linedef.

<p><dt>Make rectangular boss (32x16)
<dd>Same thing as "Make rectangular nook" but the
resulting figure is convex.

<p><dt>Set length (move 1st vertex)
<dd>Prompts you for a length and moves the 1st vertex
of the selected linedefs so that they have the length
you specified. 

<p><dt>Set length (move 2nd vertex)
<dd>Same thing as "Set length (move 1st vertex) but
moves the 2nd vertex.

<p><dt>Unlink 1st sidedef
<dd>This function is used when you have several linedefs
sharing common sidedefs and you don't want them to share
any sidedefs anymore so that you can, for instance, change
the sector reference or texture of one of the linedefs
independently from the others.
<p>
Here is how it works&nbsp;: all sidedefs that are used on the
first side of any linedef in the selection and on any
side of any linedef <em>not</em> in the selection are
duplicated and the first side of the concerned linedefs
in the selection is set to use the copy instead of the
original.
<p>
Gotcha&nbsp;: note that the selected linedefs are not "unlinked"
from each other. They are only "unlinked" from any other
(i.e. non-selected) linedefs. Thus, if you have <em>n</em>
linedefs that you want to unlink from each other, you have
to unlink every one of them separately. This is so that, if
you have, say, two square pillars (2 x 4 linedefs that all
use the same sidedef), you can easily unlink one pillar from
the other while still having its 4 linedefs all use the same
sidedef.

<p><dt>Unlink 2nd sidedef
<dd>Same as "Unlink 1st sidedef" but with second sidedef
instead of first sidedef.

</dl>

		<h3>Setting/toggling/clearing linedef flags</h3>

In linedefs mode, press [<kbd>a</kbd>]
to open the "set linedef flags" popup menu.
<br>Press [<kbd>b</kbd>] to open the "toggle linedef flags" popup menu.

	<h2>7. Configuring and customizing Yadex</h2>

There are several ways to configure Yadex&nbsp;:
the configuration file, the environment variables,
the command line options and the Preferences menu.
<p>
The choices made in the Preferences menu
override all others but they are lost when you exit Yadex.
<p>
The command line options override
the environment variables which in turn override
the configuration file.
<p>
The details of command line options and environment variables
are explained elsewhere.

		<h3>Preferences</h3>

When you create objects, their properties are
automatically given default values.
Some of those default values can be set from the configuration file
or from the command line but also through the Preferences menu,
that pops up when you press [<kbd>F5</kbd>].
<p>
The settings entered through the Preferences menu
are lost when you exit Yadex.

		<h3>Configuration file</h3>

If you don't specify "<code>-f</code>" on the command line,
Yadex tries to open the following files in order&nbsp;:
<p>
<ol>
<li><code>./yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>~/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code><i>install_dir</i>/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg</code>
<li><code>/etc/yadex.cfg</code>
</ol>
<p>
The first file found is used.
<p>
If you use "<code>-f <i>file</i></code>"
and "<code><i>file</i></code>" is an absolute name
(i.e. it starts with "<code>/</code>"), only that name is used.
<p>
If "<code><i>file</i></code>" is a relative name,
the standard directories will be searched for a file of that name
instead of "<code>yadex.cfg</code>".
For example, if you specify "<code>-f foo/bar</code>",
Yadex will try to open
"<code>./foo/bar</code>", "<code>~/foo/bar</code>", and so on.
<p>
The first line of the configuration file must contain exactly
the following string :
<p>
"<code># Yadex configuration file version 2</code>"
<p>
If it doesn't, Yadex will print an error message and bail out.
The reason for being so fussy is to avoid headaches when the
configuration file format changes and there are old configuration
files lying around in your directories.
<p>
The configuration file is self-documenting.
Look at the sample configuration file in the Yadex distribution
to see what options are available.

		<h3>Game definition files</h3>

A lot of Yadex's knowledge about thing numbers and names,
linedef types etc. is stored in so-called game definition files.
When you specify "<code>-g foo</code>,
it in fact means that Yadex should use the game definition file
named "<code>foo.ygd</code>".
As of this release three games are supported&nbsp;:
"<code>doom</code>", "<code>doom2</code>" and "<code>heretic</code>"
(though, as I'm not familiar with Heretic editing,
<code>heretic.ygd</code> might contain errors and omissions).
<p>
To open the game definition file,
Yadex tries those names in order&nbsp;:
<ol>
<li><code>./<i>game</i>.ygd</code>
<li><code>~/<i>game</i>.ygd</code>
<li><code><i>install_dir</i>/<i>game</i>.ygd</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/<i>game</i>.ygd</code>
<li><code>/usr/share/games/<i>game</i>.ygd</code>
</ol>
The first line of a game definition file must contain exactly
the following string :
<p>
"<code># Yadex game definition file version 1</code>"
<p>
If it doesn't, Yadex will print an error message and bail out.
The reason for being so fussy is to avoid headaches when the
game definition file format changes and there are old game
definition files lying around in your directories.
<p>
The contents are pretty self explanatory.

		<h3>The font</h3>

By default, Yadex uses the default font of your system
(that is often "<code>fixed</code>" a.k.a. "<code>6x13</code>").
But you can use the font of your choice by
using the "<code>-fn </code><i>font_name</i>" option
or setting "<code>font&nbsp;=&nbsp;</code><i>font_name</i>"
in <code>yadex.cfg</code>.
You should use a fixed-width font
and not one that is too large for the size of your Yadex window
or the display will look ugly.
<p>
You can get a list of all available fonts on your system
with the command <code>xlsfonts</code>.

	</p><hr noshade>
	<h2><a name="bugs">
	Annex A: known bugs</a></h2>

Though Yadex has quite a few bugs,
most of them are inconsequential,
i.e. not likely to make Yadex unusable or damage precious data.
On the other hand, <strong>some can bite</strong>.
Those are the ones you should know about&nbsp;:

<ul>
<li>Command line options that take an argument
need to have a space between their argument and themselves.

<li>Exposure events are not always handled.
If the Yadex window turns black,
back out by pressing [<kbd>Esc</kbd>],
several times if necessary.

<li>If you edit a level from a file that contains several and save it,
all the other levels from that file are lost.
</ul>

Check <a href="TODO"><code>TODO</code></a> for a complete list
of things to fix.

	<h2><a name="diffs">
	Annex B: differences between Yadex and DEU 5.21</a></h2>

<strong>Warning&nbsp;: this section is badly out of date.</strong>
<p>
Yadex is derived from DEU 5.21. So if you're used to DEU 5.21, you
might find this list useful.
<p>
1. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

<ul>
<li> ADDED SUPPORT FOR VERSIONS OF DOOM BEYOND 1.2
  Added support for levels E4Mn. Added linedef and sector types
  introduced with Doom v1.666.
<li> ADDED SUPPORT FOR DOOM II
  Added support for levels MAPnn. Added new linedef and sector types
  (see above). Added reading sector and wall textures from doom2.wad.
  Added definition of Doom II things.
  You now have to replace main= in the config.file by iwad1= and
  iwad2= and invoke yadex with either "-g doom" or "-g doom2".

<li> INTEGRATED INFO FROM DOOM SPECS 1.6
  Corrected linedef types and sector types. Reordered sector types.
  Added new linedef and sector types (see above).

<li> EDITING IN GENERAL
  <ul>
  <li> Highlighting: it does not require as much a precise positionning
    of the pointer as it did (+/-8 pixels instead of +/-4).
  <li> Made PU PD END HOME scroll only 1/6 screen at a time (not 1/2)
  <li> Grid: also highlights multiples of 1024 or 256 or 64. This is
    useful when you are working with small grid steps (E.G. 8) but
    still need to align to 64.
  <li> Grid: you can now have a grid finer than 8 or coarser than 256.
    So you can now do 4-alignment or even 2-alignment. There are two
    new parameters (gridmin and gridmax) in the config file to set the
    low and high bounds (default&nbsp;: 4 and 256).
  <li> Zoom: added 1 extra magnification step (x8).
  <li> Zoom: vertices green crosses and linedef arrows are never drawn
    larger than they would at zoom 1.0. This makes editing of crowded
    areas easier.
  <li> Status bar: added the name of the file the level being edited comes
    from.
  <li> Made checking after moving a vertex onto a linedef much faster. This
    should be a relief when connecting sectors together
  <li> Map: now drawn faster, especially when viewing only a part of it.
  </ul>

<li> EDITING THINGS
  <ul>
  <li> Rotate things with W and X in things mode.
  <li> The thing type dialog is slightly better.
  <li> You can now enter type in the range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> EDITING SECTORS
  <ul>
  <li> Added raising or lowering of a group of sectors.
  <li> Added brightening or darkening of a group of sectors.
  <li> Added display of the headroom (ceiling height - floor height).
  <li> You can now enter type, tag, floor height and ceiling height in the
    range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> EDITING LINEDEFS & SIDEDEFS
  <ul>
  <li> Added function to remove the 2nd sidedef (make linedef single-sided).
  <li> Added function to make a nook or a boss.
  <li> Added function to set length of linedef by moving either vertex.
  <li> You can now enter type, tag, sidedef x-offset and sidedef y-offset
    in the range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> GENERAL
  <ul>
  <li> The slash is also recognized in file names.
  <li> You can omit the ".wad" in the names of patch wads files (after
    -pw, -file, READ).
  <li> Consumes about 20 kB less memory than DEU 5.21 did.
  </ul>

<li> CAN BE RUN FROM ANY DIRECTORY
  <ul>
  <li> The .bgi driver is searched for in the directory where yadex is
    installed (i.e. where yadex.exe is), not in the current directory.
  <li> If the config file (yadex.cfg) is not found in the current directory,
    it is searched for in the installation directory. On the other hand,
    if the config file is specified with -config on the command line,
    default locations are not used.
  </ul>
  Deu was difficult to run from another directory that its own. Now you
  can run it from the directory where the file to edit is, just like you
  do with, for example, a text editor. That's a bit of improvement,
  believe me! And you still have the possibility of having a .cfg in the
  current directory, if you want to have different settings locally.
  You have several different approaches to making yadex available from
  anywhere&nbsp;:
  1. put yadex.exe and the .bgi you need in one of the directories of
     your PATH
  2. add the yadex directory to your path.
  3. make a yadex.bat in one of the directories of your path with the
     line "@&lt;yadex_directory&gt;\yadex %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
  Each solution has pros and cons.

<li> DELETED NODES BUILDER. Nodes are NEVER built and you are not queried
  whether to do it. In 1994, the nodes builder of DEU 5.21 was a
  pioneer and we have to thank RQ for having done it. However, in 1997,
  it is perceived as slow and buggy. Better to use an external nodes
  builder (I use bsp 2.1).

<li> SYNTAX OF THE "EDIT" AND "CREATE" COMMANDS
  They now take only one argument. It may be either a complete level
  name (such as "e1m1" or "map01") or a number. For example, "1"
  matches "map01", "11" matches both "e1m1 and "map11", etc. If there
  is not exactly 1 level that matches the argument, a list of levels
  to choose from is displayed. It contains all levels that matched or
  all levels if 0 matched.

<li> LETS YOU USE NEW FLOOR/CEILING TEXTURES
  Understands FF_START/F_END and does the proper additions/replacements
  ATTENTION, BUG: but an old one: if you have a lump that has the same
  name as the texture to display...

<li> SCREEN SHOT, SAVING TEXTURE TO FILE
  When editing, Shift-F1 dumps the current window to a 16-colour GIF
  file named yadex.gif. Works _only_ when in 256-colour mode.
  In the image viewer, pressing shift-F1 saves the current image to a
  file of the same name as the image followed by ".gif". That's the
  only way I know to extract a texture.

<li> LOG FILE
  To help you keep track of time spent on a wad, Yadex writes down the
  number of minutes spent editing in a log file. The name of the log
  file is the same as the name of the .wad file except it has the
  extension ".yl". The log file is _not_ created if it does not already
  exist. Example&nbsp;: if you want to enable logging for /foo/bar.wad,
  you should first create the file /foo/bar.yl.
</ul>


2. COSMETIC CHANGES

<ul>
<li> #ifdef'd out the funny message (assuming this is used by wizards)
  and the "Goodbye..." message
<li> Do not force anymore the name of pwads to upper case.
<li> changed "LineDefs and SideDefs" to "LD & SD" to make room in the
  status bar.
<li> **Spector -&gt; Spectre, **Sargeant -&gt; Sergeant
<li> "Misc operations" menus now have "..." where due.
<li> When drawing the map, negative linedef types and linedef/sector tags
  are now considered non-zero.
</ul>


3. TECHNICAL CHANGES

<ul>
<li> Replaced c:\bc4\lib by g:\dt\bcpp.402\lib.
<li> Replaced d:\bc4\include by g:\dt\bcpp.402\include.
<li> Removed both "-v" from compiler options.
<li> Added "-mh" to compiler options.
<li> Removed "/v" from linker options.
<li> Removed some private functions from deu.h (SelectLevel).
<li> Do not demand anymore that an EnMn/MAPnn entry have a length of 0
  because MAP05 and MAP10 in dyst3 failed that test. Just print a
  warning.
<li> Further externalized paths in the makefile...
<li> Increased overlay granularity (to improve memory consumption).
<li> In the makefile, put explicit /o+ or /o- options in front of all
  modules. The following modules were previously unqualified&nbsp;: edit
  editobj objects things wads aym scrnshot. They now all have /o+.
<li> Put all modules in alphabetical order in deu.h and in the makefile.
</ul>

4. BUGS OF DEU 5.21 FIXED

<ul>
<li> Now you can use wall textures in PWADs without getting "Error
  reading from file" when trying to display the texture in the
  texture selector. Deutex users don't need the -deu option anymore.
<li> The numeric keypad can now be used in menus.
<li> Fixed 4 display bugs in BuildNewMainWad() and ListMasterDirectory
  that were not noticeable on a little endian machine.
<li> Menus work better&nbsp;: static right button state is now ignored (you
  have to press it) and a left button release is ignored unless the
  pointer was on an item when it was pressed.
<li> Texture viewer&nbsp;: fixed minor glitch that showed with BIGDOOR7,
  SKY1, TEKWALL1, TEKWALL5 and some others.
</ul>


5. NEW BUGS

<ul>
<li> For Doom II, some wall textures are not displayed correctly.
  Specifically, instead of SW?BRN1, SW?STARG, SW?STON2 and SW?STONE,
  SW?BRCOM is displayed. Very strange. I don't know why.
</ul>

		<h3>Other credits</h3>

In no particular order, I would like to thank the
following folks.
id Software for making Doom and thinking of the "<code>-file</code>"
option.  And releasing the source code.
Dave Taylor for porting Doom to Unix against commercial logic.
The people who created Unix and X
for giving us one of the best platforms around.
The thousands who worked on GNU, Linux, *BSD and all the free software
for giving me a chance to actually use that platform.
Colin Reed and Lee Killough for writing BSP,
releasing its source code and kindly allowing me to include it.
Udo Munk and Colin Phipps for Xdoom and Lxdoom.
TeamTNT for Boom.
The authors of the FAQs, specs and tutorials
from which I learned.
The makers of the internet for connecting us all.

	<h2>Annex E: Miscellaneous information</h2>

		<h3>What's in a name ?</h3>

In its previous incarnation, Yadex was named Yade,
which means Yet Another Doom Editor.
I later realized that this name was already taken
(by Yet Another Diagram Editor).
I decided that the easiest way to remedy this
would be to append a fifth letter.
I chose "<i>x</i>" because it has a neat regular shape
and because it evokes both Unix and X
and therefore conveys an important political message ;-).
<p>
The right way to typeset it is with a capital Y and
the rest in lower case. Think of it as of a proper noun.
